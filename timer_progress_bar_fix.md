# Timer Progress Bar Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Progress Bar Showing 0% on Second Timer
The `sessionProgress` calculation in `MultiMethodSessionViewModel` was incorrectly using `currentMethodIndex / totalMethods`, which gives 0 when on the first method (index 0).

**Fix**: Changed the calculation to:
- Use completed methods count as the base progress
- Add partial progress for the currently running method
- Account for method duration and elapsed time

### 2. Progress Bar Not Updating During Timer Sessions
The progress bar wasn't updating smoothly as the timer ran because UI updates weren't being triggered when the timer updated.

**Fix**: 
- Added `objectWillChange.send()` in `updateMethodTime()` to force UI updates
- Added `objectWillChange.send()` in `markMethodCompleted()` for immediate updates

### 3. Method Completion Not Synced Between ViewModels
When a method was marked as completed in SessionCompletionViewModel, it wasn't being reflected in MultiMethodSessionViewModel.

**Fix**: Updated `handleTimerCompletion()` in DailyRoutineView to call both:
- `completionViewModel.updateMethodProgress()` 
- `sessionViewModel.markMethodCompleted()`

## Code Changes

1. **MultiMethodSessionViewModel.swift**:
   - Fixed `sessionProgress` computed property to calculate accurate progress
   - Added UI update triggers in `updateMethodTime()` and `markMethodCompleted()`

2. **DailyRoutineView.swift**:
   - Added call to `sessionViewModel.markMethodCompleted()` when timer completes

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Start a multi-method routine with 3 methods
2. Complete the first method - progress should show 33%
3. Start the second method - progress should remain at 33% and increase smoothly
4. Progress bar should update in real-time as the timer counts down
5. Completing all methods should show 100% progress

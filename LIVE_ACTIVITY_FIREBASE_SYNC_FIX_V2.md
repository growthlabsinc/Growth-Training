# Live Activity Firebase Sync Fix - Version 2

## Issue Summary
From the logs at 18:49:41, the pause button is working but Firebase synchronization is blocking:
1. Pause action received and processed correctly
2. Live Activity updated locally
3. Firebase update blocked: "‚ö†Ô∏è Another Firebase update is in progress, skipping pause update"

## Root Cause
The `pauseTimer()` method was calling `sendPushUpdate()` which tried to acquire the synchronization lock again, creating a deadlock scenario since `pauseTimer()` already held the lock.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Internal Update Method
Added `sendPushUpdateInternal()` that doesn't use synchronization since it's called from already synchronized contexts:

```swift
// Internal version without synchronization (called from already synchronized methods)
private func sendPushUpdateInternal(contentState: TimerActivityAttributes.ContentState, action: String) async {
    guard let activity = currentActivity else { return }
    
    let activityId = activity.id
    
    // Store state in Firestore
    await storeTimerStateInFirestore(
        activityId: activityId,
        contentState: contentState,
        action: action
    )
    
    // Trigger push via Firebase Function
    guard let userId = Auth.auth().currentUser?.uid else { return }
    
    let functions = Functions.functions()
    let data: [String: Any] = [
        "activityId": activityId,
        "userId": userId,
        "action": action == "pause" || action == "resume" ? "update" : action
    ]
    
    do {
        print("üîÑ Calling Firebase function updateLiveActivitySimplified for action: \(action)")
        _ = try await functions.httpsCallable("updateLiveActivitySimplified").call(data)
        print("‚úÖ Push update sent successfully")
    } catch {
        print("‚ùå Failed to send push update: \(error)")
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated Method Calls
Changed `pauseTimer()` and `resumeTimer()` to use the internal method:
- `await sendPushUpdate()` ‚Üí `await sendPushUpdateInternal()`

This prevents the double-locking issue while maintaining thread safety.

## Additional Observations

### App Group Warning
The logs show:
```
Couldn't read values in CFPrefsPlistSource<0x108ba8e80> (Domain: group.com.growthlabs.growthmethod, User: kCFPreferencesAnyUser, ByHost: Yes, Container: (null), Contents Need Refresh: Yes): Using kCFPreferencesAnyUser with a container is only allowed for System Containers
```

This is a known iOS warning when accessing App Groups and doesn't affect functionality.

### App Check Token
The logs show the App Check debug token is working correctly:
- Token: `76B18093-7B65-4011-B375-F5AD92B9804F`
- Successfully retrieved and validated

## Testing the Fix

1. Build and run the app
2. Start a timer
3. Press the pause button on Live Activity
4. Should see:
   - Immediate local update (pause icon changes)
   - Firebase function called successfully
   - No "Another Firebase update is in progress" warnings

## Files Modified
- `/Growth/Features/Timer/Services/LiveActivityManagerSimplified.swift`
  - Added `sendPushUpdateInternal()` method
  - Updated `pauseTimer()` and `resumeTimer()` to use internal method
  - Maintained synchronization for external calls

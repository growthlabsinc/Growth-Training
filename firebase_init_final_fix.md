# Firebase Initialization Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
The error "The default Firebase app has not yet been configured" was appearing because AuthViewModel was being initialized as a @StateObject in the @main struct, which happens before AppDelegate's didFinishLaunchingWithOptions where Firebase is configured.

## Root Cause
SwiftUI's @StateObject property wrapper initializes its value before the app delegate runs, causing AuthService to be created before Firebase is configured.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created DeferredAuthService
A wrapper around AuthService that:
- Delays AuthService initialization until first use
- Checks if Firebase is configured before accessing any Firebase services
- Returns safe defaults if Firebase isn't ready

### 2. Updated AuthViewModel
Changed the default AuthService parameter to use DeferredAuthService instead:
```swift
init(authService: AuthServiceProtocol = DeferredAuthService())
```

### 3. Fixed Duplicate init() in GrowthAppApp
Merged two init() methods into one to avoid compilation errors.

### 4. Added Delay to Auth Check
Added a 0.5-second delay before checking Auth.auth().currentUser in the .task modifier.

### 5. Fixed AICoachService
Changed firebaseClient from direct initialization to lazy property.

## Debug Output Added
- GrowthAppApp init timing
- AuthViewModel creation timing  
- AuthService/DeferredAuthService creation timing
- AppDelegate Firebase configuration timing
- FirebaseClient configuration timing

## Testing
Run the app and verify:
1. No Firebase configuration error appears at startup
2. Debug output shows proper initialization order
3. Authentication still works correctly

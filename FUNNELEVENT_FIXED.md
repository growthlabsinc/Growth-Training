# FunnelEvent.swift - Compilation Errors Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ FeatureType Ambiguity
- **Problem**: FeatureType was ambiguous due to duplicate definition in AICoachService.swift
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate FeatureType enum from AICoachService.swift
- Updated FeatureAccess.from() to use String parameter instead of FeatureType

### 2. ✅ Missing PaywallContext Enum
- **Problem**: PaywallContext enum was referenced but never defined
- **Solution**: Added the missing enum definition based on usage in the extension:

```swift
public enum PaywallContext: Equatable, Codable {
    case featureGate(FeatureType)
    case settings
    case onboarding
    case sessionCompletion
    case general
}
```

## Changes Made

### In AICoachService.swift:
- Removed duplicate `FeatureType` enum
- Changed `FeatureAccess.from(feature: FeatureType)` to `FeatureAccess.from(feature: String)`
- Updated call site to use string literal: `FeatureAccess.from(feature: "ai_coach")`

### In FunnelEvent.swift:
- Added missing `PaywallContext` enum definition before the extension
- The enum matches the expected cases based on the toString() and fromString() methods

## Result
Both compilation errors in FunnelEvent.swift are now resolved:
- No more FeatureType ambiguity
- PaywallContext.featureGate case now exists and compiles correctly

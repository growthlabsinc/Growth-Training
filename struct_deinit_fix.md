# Fixed Struct Deinitializer Error

## Error
```
Deinitializer cannot be declared in struct 'PremiumMethodSelectionView' that conforms to 'Copyable'
```

## Root Cause
Structs in Swift cannot have deinitializers (`deinit`). Only classes can have deinitializers because structs are value types and don't need explicit deinitialization.

## Fix Applied

### Removed Invalid Code
```swift
// REMOVED - This was causing the error
deinit {
    // Ensure cleanup happens
    NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self)
}
```

### Also Removed
```swift
// REMOVED - Can't have uninitialized stored properties in structs
private var notificationCancellable: NSObjectProtocol?
```

## Alternative Approach for Cleanup

The cleanup is already handled properly in the `onDisappear` modifier:

```swift
.onDisappear {
    // Post notification only when leaving the view
    NotificationCenter.default.post(
        name: Notification.Name("MethodSchedulingUpdated"),
        object: methodScheduling
    )
    // Clear expanded state to free memory
    expandedMethodId = nil
    searchText = ""
}
```

## Key Points

1. **Structs are value types**: They don't need deinitializers
2. **Use onDisappear**: For cleanup in SwiftUI views
3. **StateObject handles cleanup**: The `@StateObject` property wrapper automatically manages the lifecycle of `methodsLoader`
4. **NotificationCenter**: SwiftUI views using `.onReceive` automatically handle observer cleanup

The memory optimizations are still in place through:
- Proper cleanup in `MethodsLoader` class (which can have deinit)
- State cleanup in `onDisappear`
- Weak self references in closures
- Removal of memory-intensive animations

# UI Theme Types Fix

## Problem
Multiple UI component files reported "Cannot find in scope" errors for:
- `AppTheme`
- `GrowthUITheme`
- `ThemeManager`
- `Logger`

## Investigation
These types DO exist in the project:
- `AppTheme` - struct defined in `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTheme.swift` (line 204)
- `GrowthUITheme` - enum defined in `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTheme.swift` (line 13)
- `ThemeManager` - defined in `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/ThemeManager.swift`

## Root Cause
The types are not being found because:
1. The files may not be included in the same build target
2. The module structure may not be properly configured in Xcode

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Added Documentation Comments
Added comments to AnimatedPrimaryButton.swift indicating where types are defined:
```swift
// Note: The following types are defined elsewhere in the project:
// - AppTheme: Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTheme.swift
// - GrowthUITheme: Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTheme.swift
// - ThemeManager: Growth/Core/UI/Theme/ThemeManager.swift
```

### 2. Fixed Logger References
Replaced `Logger.debug()` with `print("[DEBUG] ")` for debugging output

## To Fix in Xcode

### Ensure All Files Are in Same Target
1. Select these files in Xcode:
   - `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTheme.swift`
   - `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/ThemeManager.swift`
   - All UI component files showing errors
2. In File Inspector, ensure they're all checked for the main app target

### Alternative: Create Module Import
If the theme files are in a separate module, add:
```swift
import GrowthTheme  // Or whatever the module name is
```

## Files Affected
All files in `Growth/Core/UI/Components/` that reference:
- AppTheme
- GrowthUITheme
- ThemeManager

## Result
- Documentation added to clarify type locations
- Logger references fixed
- Build target membership needs to be verified in Xcode for complete fix

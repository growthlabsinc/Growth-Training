# Live Activity Fix Status

## Date: 2025-09-11

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. iOS Availability Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: `activity.content` property was being accessed outside iOS 16.2 availability check
- **Fix**: Moved the logging code inside the iOS 16.2 availability check in `LiveActivityManager.swift:954-964`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### 2. Live Activity Pause/Resume Time Calculation
- **Problem**: Timer showed incorrect time after pause/resume - jumping to wrong time
- **Fix**: Properly adjusting `startedAt` forward by pause duration when resuming
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed with comprehensive logging

### 3. Monitoring Script Created
- **Created**: `monitor_live_activity.sh` for real-time Live Activity monitoring
- **Features**: Color-coded event tracking for pause/resume/start/stop events
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Ready to use

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Issues

### Firebase Deployment
- **Issue**: Firebase functions deployment failing with HTTP 409 errors
- **Cause**: Another deployment is in progress blocking updates
- **Impact**: Push updates for Live Activities may still use old code
- **Action**: Wait and retry deployment later

## Testing Instructions

### Build and Test
```bash
# Build the app in Debug mode
./build_debug.sh

# Monitor Live Activity events
./monitor_live_activity.sh
```

### Test Pause/Resume
1. Start a countdown timer (e.g., 20 minutes)
2. Let it run for 5 minutes
3. Pause the timer - note the remaining time
4. Wait any amount of time
5. Resume the timer
6. **Expected**: Timer continues from where it was paused (e.g., 15:00 remaining)

### Monitor Logs
Watch for these key log entries:
- `üîç [PAUSE] Live Activity pause details`
- `üîç [RESUME] Live Activity resume details`
- `üìä Pause timing` - Shows elapsed and remaining time
- `üìä Resume timing` - Shows pause duration and adjusted times

## Code Changes Summary

### LiveActivityManager.swift
- Lines 954-964: Moved logging inside iOS 16.2 availability check
- Lines 933-1000: Added comprehensive pause/resume logging
- Lines 510-545: Adjusting startedAt on resume for correct time calculation

### Firebase Functions (Pending)
- `liveActivityUpdates.js`: Updated to use correct APNS keys for dev/prod
- Status: Changes ready but deployment blocked

## Next Steps
1. Wait for current Firebase deployment to complete
2. Retry Firebase deployment: `firebase deploy --only functions:updateLiveActivity`
3. Test on physical device with new build
4. Monitor using `./monitor_live_activity.sh`

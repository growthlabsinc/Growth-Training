# DevelopmentToolsView Fix Summary

## Issue
The "Reset Today's Routine" button in Development Tools wasn't working - nothing happened when tapped.

## Root Causes
1. Missing error handling to show when there's no selected routine
2. Compilation errors due to missing type imports in DEBUG-only code
3. No user feedback when operations succeed or fail

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Error Handling
- Added `routineResetError` and `routineResetErrorMessage` state variables
- Added error alert to show when:
  - No authenticated user is found
  - No routine is selected
  - Firebase operations fail

### 2. Fixed Compilation Issues
- Added `import FirebaseFirestore` 
- Replaced service calls with direct Firestore operations since services weren't in scope
- Removed AuthViewModel environment object reference

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- Added console logging at each step of the reset process
- Added print statements to confirm button tap and function execution

### 4. Direct Firestore Implementation
Instead of using services (which weren't accessible), implemented direct Firestore calls:
- Fetch selected routine ID directly from user document
- Query and delete session logs for today
- Update routine progress document to reset completion status

## How It Works Now

When the user taps "Reset Today's Routine":
1. Checks if user is authenticated (shows error if not)
2. Fetches the user's selected routine ID (shows error if none selected)
3. Deletes all session logs for today
4. Resets the routine progress:
   - Clears `completedDate` and `startedDate`
   - Resets `nextMethodIndex` to 0
   - Sets `scheduledDate` to today
5. Posts a notification to update the UI
6. Shows success or error message

## Testing
To test the functionality:
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Select a routine from the Routines tab first
3. Complete some methods for today
4. Go to Settings > Developer Options
5. Tap "Reset Today's Routine"
6. You should see either a success message or an error explaining what went wrong

The console will show detailed logs of each step for debugging.

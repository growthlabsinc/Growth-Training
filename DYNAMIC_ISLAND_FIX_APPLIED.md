# Dynamic Island UI Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
The Dynamic Island UI improvements were being applied to the wrong file. The app uses `GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivityNew.swift`, not `GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivity.swift`.

## Changes Made to GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivityNew.swift

### 1. **Expanded View - Premium Design**
- **Method name**: Increased from 14px to 18px semibold
- **Timer display**: Increased from 28px to 36px heavy with rounded design
- **Added session type label**: "REMAINING" or "ELAPSED" in small caps
- **Pause/Resume button**: Now a 44x44 circular button with better visual states
- **Cleaner layout**: Better spacing (8px between elements)

### 2. **Compact View - Less Wide**
- **Removed extra elements**: No more pause indicator or extra icons
- **Simplified to essentials**:
  - Leading: Single timer icon (12px)
  - Trailing: Time display only (14px, rounded font)
- **Better use of space**: Removed unnecessary padding

### 3. **Minimal View - Cleaner**
- Reduced icon size from 16px to 12px
- Consistent with compact view styling

## Result
The Dynamic Island now:
- Feels more premium with larger, clearer typography
- Takes up less horizontal space in compact mode
- Follows Apple's design principles with better visual hierarchy
- Provides clear focus on the timer with minimal distractions

## Testing
To see the changes:
1. Build and run the app
2. Start a timer
3. Check the Dynamic Island in both compact and expanded states

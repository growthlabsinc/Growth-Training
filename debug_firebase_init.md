# Debug Steps for Firebase Initialization

## Current Status
We've added debugging statements to trace the Firebase initialization order:

1. **GrowthAppApp.swift**:
   - Added debug print in init()
   - Added debug print when creating AuthViewModel
   - Added delay before accessing Auth.auth().currentUser

2. **AppDelegate.swift**:
   - Added debug prints before and after Firebase configuration

3. **FirebaseClient.swift**:
   - Already has debug print when configure() is called

4. **AuthViewModel.swift**:
   - Added debug print when AuthViewModel is created
   - Added debug print when AuthService is created

5. **AuthService.swift**:
   - Added debug print in init()
   - Added debug print before setupAuthStateListener

## Expected Debug Output Order
1. GrowthTrainingApp init called
2. Creating AuthViewModel
3. AuthViewModel init called
4. AuthService init called
5. AppDelegate.didFinishLaunchingWithOptions called
6. About to configure Firebase
7. FirebaseClient.configure called
8. Firebase configured

## Next Steps
1. Run the app and check the debug output order
2. Look for any Firebase access that happens before "FirebaseClient.configure called"
3. If the error still appears before Firebase configuration, we need to look for:
   - Static initializers we missed
   - Framework initialization code
   - Build settings that might be initializing Firebase

## How to Revert if Needed

### Option 1: Using Git Tag (Recommended)

git status

# If you have uncommitted changes you want to discard
git reset --hard

# Revert to the tagged state
git reset --hard pre-live-activity-overhaul

# Verify you're at the correct commit
git log --oneline -n 1
# Should show: 07bbd1e feat: Major fixes and improvements before Live Activity overhaul
```

### Option 2: Using Backup Branch
```bash
# Switch to the backup branch
git checkout backup/pre-live-activity-overhaul

# Create a new branch from this point if needed
git checkout -b main-restored

# Or reset main to this point
git checkout main
git reset --hard backup/pre-live-activity-overhaul
```

### Option 3: Using Commit Hash Directly
```bash
# Reset to the specific commit
git reset --hard 07bbd1e
```

## Verifying the Restoration

After reverting, verify:
1. Check git log shows the correct commit
2. Build the project to ensure no compilation errors
3. Run the app and test basic functionality
4. Verify Live Activity features work as before

## Important Notes
- This checkpoint was created before any Live Activity overhaul changes
- All features should be working as documented in the commit message
- The backup branch will remain untouched as a failsafe

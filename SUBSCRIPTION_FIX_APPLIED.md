# Subscription State Synchronization Fix Applied

## Problem
After successfully purchasing a premium subscription in debug mode (Xcode), the AI Coach view remained locked.

## Root Cause
1. **Incorrect async/await pattern** in `PurchaseManager.swift`:
   - Line 94 had: `if let subscriptionStateManager = try? await SubscriptionStateManager.shared`
   - `SubscriptionStateManager.shared` is not an async property, causing the refresh to be skipped
   
2. **Synchronous call to async method**:
   - `FeatureGateService.shared.refreshAccessState()` was called synchronously
   - Should use `await FeatureGateService.shared.forceRefresh()` to ensure state is fully updated

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: PurchaseManager.swift Line 94
**Before:**
```swift
if let subscriptionStateManager = try? await SubscriptionStateManager.shared {
    await subscriptionStateManager.refreshState()
}
```

**After:**
```swift
await SubscriptionStateManager.shared.refreshState()
```

### Fix 2: PurchaseManager.swift Line 264-269
**Before:**
```swift
if let subscriptionStateManager = try? await SubscriptionStateManager.shared {
    await subscriptionStateManager.forceRefresh()
}
FeatureGateService.shared.refreshAccessState()
```

**After:**
```swift
await SubscriptionStateManager.shared.forceRefresh()
await FeatureGateService.shared.forceRefresh()
```

## Why This Fixes the AI Coach Lock Issue

1. **Proper State Update Chain**:
   - `updatePurchasedProducts()` → Updates StoreKit service with new purchases
   - `SubscriptionStateManager.forceRefresh()` → Forces subscription state to update from StoreKit
   - `FeatureGateService.forceRefresh()` → Updates feature access based on new subscription state

2. **Async/Await Correctness**:
   - All state updates now properly await completion before proceeding
   - No more skipped refreshes due to incorrect optional binding

## Testing Instructions

1. Clean build folder (⌘+Shift+K)
2. Run app in Xcode with debug scheme
3. Navigate to Settings → Subscription
4. Purchase Premium subscription
5. After purchase completes, navigate to AI Coach
6. **Expected**: AI Coach should be immediately accessible

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Add Logging** to verify state updates:
```swift
Logger.info("Before refresh - AI Coach Access: \(FeatureGateService.shared.hasAccessBool(to: .aiCoach))")
await FeatureGateService.shared.forceRefresh()
Logger.info("After refresh - AI Coach Access: \(FeatureGateService.shared.hasAccessBool(to: .aiCoach))")
```

2. **Simplify Architecture** (Future):
   - Consider removing redundant state managers
   - Use StoreKit 2's `Transaction.currentEntitlements` as single source of truth
   - Reduce from 5 services to 2-3 services maximum

3. **Add Debug UI** (Optional):
   - Add a debug button in Settings to manually refresh subscription state
   - Display current subscription tier and feature access in debug mode

# Live Activity Stop Button Fix

## Issue
The Live Activity stop button was not:
1. Stopping the timer
2. Opening the app in practice view

## Root Cause
The StopTimerAndOpenAppIntent was using LiveActivityIntent protocol but wasn't properly configured for cross-process communication between the widget extension and main app.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created StopTimerAndOpenAppIntent with LiveActivityIntent
- Uses `LiveActivityIntent` protocol instead of `AppIntent`
- Sets `openAppWhenRun = true` to open the app
- Posts Darwin notification for timer stop action
- Saves navigation intent to UserDefaults

### 2. Fixed Darwin Notification Listener
- Updated `TimerIntentObserver` to listen for both notification patterns:
  - `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.liveactivity.{timerType}.{action}`
  - `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.timerAction.{action}` (used by StopTimerAndOpenAppIntent)
- Re-enabled TimerIntentObserver initialization in AppDelegate

### 3. File Structure
- Created `StopTimerAndOpenAppIntent.swift` in widget directory
- Created symlink to app target directory for shared access
- Both targets can now use the same intent implementation

### 4. Processing Flow
1. User taps stop button â†’ triggers StopTimerAndOpenAppIntent
2. Intent saves action to UserDefaults and posts Darwin notification
3. TimerIntentObserver receives notification and stops timer
4. AppSceneDelegate checks UserDefaults on app activation
5. Navigation to practice view occurs after timer stops

### 5. Key Files Modified
- `/GrowthTimerWidget/StopTimerAndOpenAppIntent.swift` - New intent implementation
- `/GrowthTimerWidget/TimerControlIntent.swift` - Removed duplicate intent
- `/Growth/Features/Timer/Services/TimerIntentObserver.swift` - Added listener for timerAction.* pattern
- `/Growth/Application/AppDelegate.swift` - Re-enabled TimerIntentObserver
- `/Growth/Application/AppSceneDelegate.swift` - Processes widget actions on app activation

## Testing Instructions
1. Start a timer in the app
2. Leave the app to show Live Activity
3. Press stop button in Live Activity
4. Verify:
   - Timer stops
   - App opens
   - Navigates to practice view
   - Completion sheet shows if timer ran long enough

## Debug Logging
Added debug logging in:
- StopTimerAndOpenAppIntent.perform() - logs when triggered
- TimerIntentObserver - logs when Darwin notification received
- AppSceneDelegate - logs when widget action processed

Look for these log messages:
- "ðŸŽ¯ StopTimerAndOpenAppIntent TRIGGERED"
- "ðŸ’¾ Saved stop action to UserDefaults"
- "âœ… Stop action posted via Darwin notification"
- "ðŸŽ¯ AppSceneDelegate: Found widget timer action: stop"
- "ðŸ›‘ Processing stop action from widget"

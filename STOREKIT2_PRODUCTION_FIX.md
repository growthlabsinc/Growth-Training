# StoreKit2 Production Fix for TestFlight

## Problem Analysis
The StoreKit2 products are not loading in both Debug mode AND TestFlight/Production. This indicates the products are not properly configured in App Store Connect.

## Root Causes
1. **Products not created in App Store Connect** - The subscription products must exist in App Store Connect
2. **Products not approved/ready for sale** - Products must be in "Ready to Submit" or "Approved" state
3. **StoreKit configuration file only works for local testing** - Not for TestFlight/Production

## Production Fix Steps

### Step 1: Create Products in App Store Connect

1. Log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Select your app: **Growth: Method** (Bundle ID: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod`)
3. Go to **Features** → **In-App Purchases**
4. Click the **"+"** button to create new products

Create these THREE subscription products:

#### Product 1: Weekly Subscription
- **Reference Name**: Growth Premium Weekly
- **Product ID**: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.weekly`
- **Type**: Auto-Renewable Subscription
- **Price**: $4.99 USD
- **Duration**: 1 Week
- **Description**: Weekly subscription for premium Growth Method

#### Product 2: Quarterly Subscription
- **Reference Name**: Growth Premium Quarterly
- **Product ID**: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.quarterly`
- **Type**: Auto-Renewable Subscription
- **Price**: $29.99 USD
- **Duration**: 3 Months
- **Description**: 3 month subscription for Growth Method Pro

#### Product 3: Yearly Subscription
- **Reference Name**: Growth Premium Yearly
- **Product ID**: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.yearly`
- **Type**: Auto-Renewable Subscription
- **Price**: $49.99 USD
- **Duration**: 1 Year
- **Description**: Yearly subscription for premium Growth Method

### Step 2: Configure Subscription Group

1. In App Store Connect, go to **Features** → **Subscriptions**
2. Create a subscription group named: **Growth: Method Pro**
3. Add all three subscriptions to this group
4. Set the group levels (higher level = better value):
   - Level 1: Weekly
   - Level 2: Quarterly
   - Level 2: Yearly

### Step 3: Fill in Required Metadata

For EACH subscription, you must provide:
- **Localization** (at least English)
- **Display Name** 
- **Description**
- **Subscription Group Localized Name**
- **Screenshot** (required for review)

### Step 4: Banking and Tax Information

Ensure you have:
1. **Paid Applications Agreement** - Must be active
2. **Banking Information** - Must be complete
3. **Tax Forms** - Must be submitted

Check at: App Store Connect → Agreements, Tax, and Banking

### Step 5: Submit Products for Review

1. Mark each product as **"Ready to Submit"**
2. For testing in TestFlight, products can be in "Ready to Submit" state
3. For App Store release, products must be approved

### Step 6: Wait for Processing

- Products typically take **2-24 hours** to propagate to all servers
- During this time, products may not appear in TestFlight

## Immediate Testing Solution

While waiting for App Store Connect:

### For Simulator Testing (Works Now)
```bash
# Run in Xcode Simulator
1. Open Xcode
2. Select any iPhone Simulator
3. Run the app
4. Products will load from local StoreKit configuration file
```

### For TestFlight Testing (After App Store Connect Setup)
```bash
# Once products are in App Store Connect:
1. Archive the app with Release configuration
2. Upload to TestFlight
3. Products will load from App Store Connect
```

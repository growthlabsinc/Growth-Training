# TestFlight Live Activity Final Fix

## Current Status

✅ Widget extension is loading and processing intents
✅ Timer control intents are being recognized
✅ Data is being written to shared UserDefaults
✅ Widget TestFlight fix script has been run
✅ Fallback polling mechanism implemented
❌ Darwin notifications may not be reaching main app (fallback handles this)

## The Issue

The widget extension is working but the main app isn't responding to the Darwin notifications. This is likely because:

1. The main app isn't listening for Darwin notifications when launched from TestFlight
2. The Darwin notification name might be getting sandboxed

## Solution ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Fallback Polling Mechanism (COMPLETED)

The fallback polling mechanism has been implemented in `TimerService.swift`:

- **Added polling timer property**: `sharedDefaultsPollingTimer` that polls every 0.5 seconds
- **Added unique action tracking**: `lastProcessedAction` prevents duplicate processing
- **Conditional compilation**: Only runs in production builds (`#if !DEBUG`)
- **Automatic cleanup**: Timer is invalidated in deinit
- **Full action support**: Handles pause, resume, and stop actions
- **Live Activity updates**: Updates the Live Activity state after each action

### 2. Update Widget Intent to Use NotificationCenter

As a backup, also post a regular notification that the main app can listen for:

```swift
// In TimerControlIntent.swift, after Darwin notification:

// Also post a regular notification as fallback
NotificationCenter.default.post(
    name: Notification.Name("TimerActionFromWidget"),
    object: nil,
    userInfo: [
        "action": action.rawValue,
        "timerType": timerType,
        "activityId": activityId
    ]
)
```

### 3. Bundle IDs Configuration (COMPLETED)

The widget extension bundle ID has been set correctly via the Ruby script:
- Main app: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod`
- Widget: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.GrowthTimerWidget`

## Implementation Summary

✅ **Ruby script executed** - Widget extension configured for TestFlight
✅ **Fallback polling added** - TimerService now polls shared UserDefaults in production
✅ **Unique action tracking** - Prevents duplicate processing with timestamp-based identifiers
✅ **Production-only activation** - Uses `#if !DEBUG` to only run in TestFlight/App Store builds

## Testing

1. Archive with Growth Production scheme
2. Upload to TestFlight
3. Test on device
4. Check if pause/resume buttons work

If still not working, the polling mechanism will kick in as a fallback.

## Alternative: Use Local Notifications

If Darwin notifications continue to fail, we can use local notifications:

1. Widget posts a local notification
2. Main app receives it via notification center
3. Updates timer state accordingly

This requires adding notification permissions but is more reliable than Darwin notifications in sandboxed environments.

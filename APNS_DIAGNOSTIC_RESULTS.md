# APNs Diagnostic Results

## Current Status

The Firebase functions have been successfully updated to use the latest secret versions:
- **APNS_AUTH_KEY**: Version 17 (DQ46FN4PQU key)
- **APNS_KEY_ID**: Version 12 (DQ46FN4PQU)
- **APNS_TEAM_ID**: Version 3 (62T6J77P6R)

## Test Results

### Development Push Token Test
- **Push Token**: `806694954f389a10eed7d0051e467a96100dbbfe3d19bc8ce0f2c324e40a926d67dc2279c9a9e73ff1688558696e9829fad3d27d9e3ab982836782055800da888bd660b1382f8f55ef0cc8f09e1af600`
- **Server Used**: api.development.push.apple.com (correct for development key)
- **Bundle ID**: com.growthlabs.growthmethod
- **Result**: 403 InvalidProviderToken

### Direct APNs Test Results
1. **Production Server**: 400 BadDeviceToken (expected - dev token with prod server)
2. **Development Server**: 403 InvalidProviderToken (unexpected - should work)

## Error Analysis

The InvalidProviderToken error with the DQ46FN4PQU key indicates one of:
1. The key was not created with APNs capability enabled
2. The key belongs to a different Team ID
3. The key was created for a different app/bundle ID
4. The key has been revoked

## Next Steps for Apple Developer Support

When contacting Apple Developer Support, provide:

1. **Error Details**:
   - Error: 403 InvalidProviderToken
   - Key ID: DQ46FN4PQU
   - Team ID: 62T6J77P6R
   - Bundle ID: com.growthlabs.growthmethod
   - Server: api.development.push.apple.com

2. **Context**:
   - Recently migrated from personal to business Apple Developer account
   - Created new APNs key after migration
   - Key shows as "Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)" in Developer Portal
   - Using development/sandbox configuration

3. **What Works**:
   - Live Activities display correctly
   - Push tokens are generated successfully
   - ProgressView(timerInterval:) updates work without push

4. **What Doesn't Work**:
   - Any APNs authentication with the new key
   - Both development and production configurations fail

## Temporary Workaround

Until APNs is fixed, the app can still function with:
- Timer updates using ProgressView(timerInterval:) - works without push
- Manual refresh by reopening the app
- Local notifications for completion alerts

## Verification Steps

Once Apple resolves the key issue:
1. Test with `node test-apns-direct.js`
2. Verify 200 OK response
3. Deploy functions if needed
4. Test Live Activity updates in the app

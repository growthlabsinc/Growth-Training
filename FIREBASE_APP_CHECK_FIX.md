# Firebase App Check Fix Required

## Issue
The app is getting App Check errors because the new bundle ID hasn't been registered in Firebase:
```
"App not registered: 1:645068839446:ios:c49ec579111e8a65fc3337."
```

## Solution

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
   - Navigate to https://console.firebase.google.com/project/growth-70a85
   - Go to App Check section

2. **Register the new bundle ID**
   - Add app with bundle ID: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod`
   - Configure DeviceCheck provider for production
   - Configure Debug provider for development

3. **Update Firebase configuration**
   - Download new `GoogleService-Info.plist` for the new bundle ID
   - Replace the existing file in the project

## Impact
Without fixing this:
- Firebase Functions won't work properly
- Live Activity push updates will fail
- App Check will block Firebase requests

## Temporary Workaround
The app is currently using debug App Check provider which allows it to function, but this needs to be fixed for production.

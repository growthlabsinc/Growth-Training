# Dynamic Island Final Adjustments

## Changes Made Based on Screenshot

### 1. Compact View
**Removed method name from compact leading:**
- Now shows only the timer icon
- Cleaner, more minimal appearance
- Prevents text overflow in compact space

**Before:**
```swift
HStack(spacing: 4) {
    Image(systemName: "timer")
    Text(context.state.methodName)
}
```

**After:**
```swift
Image(systemName: "timer")
    .font(.system(size: 11, weight: .medium))
    .foregroundColor(Color(red: 0.2, green: 0.8, blue: 0.4))
```

### 2. Expanded View Spacing
**Reduced padding and margins:**
- Content margins: 12pt → 8pt (horizontal and vertical)
- Progress bar padding: 20pt → 12pt
- Button padding: 20pt → 16pt (horizontal)
- VStack spacing: 6pt → 4pt

### 3. Safe Area Margins
**Added explicit zero margins for compact views:**
```swift
.contentMargins(.all, 0, for: .compactLeading)
.contentMargins(.all, 0, for: .compactTrailing)
```

This ensures the compact content sits snug against the TrueDepth camera as Apple recommends.

## Result
The Dynamic Island now:
- Has a cleaner compact view with just icon and timer
- Uses less padding in expanded view for more content space
- Properly respects safe areas
- Maintains the premium look while being more space-efficient

# AppReviewSubscriptionHandler - ValidationResult Fixed

## Final Error Resolved

### âœ… ValidationResult Type Not Found
**Problem**: validateReceiptForAppReview returned ValidationResult which was deleted during StoreKit 2 migration
**Solution**: Changed return type to Bool

```swift
// BEFORE:
public func validateReceiptForAppReview(_ receiptData: String) async throws -> ValidationResult

// AFTER:
public func validateReceiptForAppReview(_ receiptData: String) async throws -> Bool
```

## Result
- All compilation errors in AppReviewSubscriptionHandler.swift are now resolved
- Method returns simple Bool indicating validation success
- No dependency on deleted ValidationResult type

## Summary of All Fixes Applied
1. Removed duplicate type definitions
2. Replaced SubscriptionServerValidator with StoreKit 2 validation
3. Fixed Logger usage
4. Removed StoreKitEnvironmentHandler references
5. Replaced SubscriptionProductIDs with inline arrays
6. Changed ValidationResult returns to Bool

The file is now fully compatible with the StoreKit 2 migration and should compile successfully.

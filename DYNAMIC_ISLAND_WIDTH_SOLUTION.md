# Dynamic Island Width Solution

## New Approach to Reduce Width

### 1. **Changed Time Format**
Instead of "12:34", now shows:
- Hours: "2h" or "2h30" 
- Minutes: "5m" or "5:30"
- Seconds: "45s"

This significantly reduces character count.

### 2. **Compact Leading - Minimal**
- Changed from icon to single dot "â€¢"
- Only 6px size
- Provides minimal visual indicator

### 3. **Compact Trailing - Constrained**
Key modifiers that actually affect width:
- `.frame(maxWidth: 40)` - Hard width limit
- `.allowsTightening(true)` - Allows tighter character spacing
- `.minimumScaleFactor(0.5)` - Can shrink to 50% if needed
- `.fixedSize()` - Prevents expansion

### 4. **Content Margins**
- Set to 0 for all compact views
- Ensures content is snug against TrueDepth camera

## Why This Works

The Dynamic Island width is determined by:
1. **Content width** - Shorter strings = narrower island
2. **Frame constraints** - maxWidth limits expansion
3. **Text compression** - allowsTightening reduces spacing
4. **Scale factor** - Text can shrink if needed

## Result
- Much narrower Dynamic Island presentation
- Time format uses 2-3 characters instead of 5-8
- Leading view is minimal (single dot)
- Trailing view has hard width constraint

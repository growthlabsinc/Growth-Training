# Developer Tools - Reset Today's Routine Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Added Visual Feedback**
   - Added `isResettingRoutine` state to show loading indicator
   - Shows ProgressView spinner while resetting
   - Disables button during reset operation
   - Changes subtitle text to "Resetting..." during operation

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added error handling for user document fetch
   - Added check for document existence before update/create
   - Properly handles both update (existing doc) and create (new doc) scenarios
   - All error paths now reset the loading state

3. **Added Cache Clearing**
   - Clears UserDefaults cache for completed methods count
   - Key format: `completedMethods_{timestamp}`

4. **Better Debug Logging**
   - Added comprehensive console logging for each step
   - Logs success/failure states with details
   - Helps debug Firestore permission issues

## How It Works

1. User taps "Reset Today's Routine" button
2. Shows confirmation alert
3. On confirm:
   - Sets loading state (shows spinner)
   - Fetches user's selected routine ID
   - Deletes all session logs for today
   - Resets or creates routine progress document with:
     - `completedDate`: null
     - `startedDate`: null
     - `nextMethodIndex`: 0
     - `scheduledDate`: today's start date
   - Clears local cache
   - Posts notification for UI update
   - Shows success/error alert

## Potential Issues to Check

1. **Firestore Permissions**: Ensure user has write access to:
   - `/users/{userId}/sessionLogs/*`
   - `/users/{userId}/routineProgress/*`

2. **Selected Routine**: User must have a routine selected in the Routines tab

3. **Authentication**: User must be logged in

## Testing Steps

1. Select a routine in Routines tab
2. Complete some methods
3. Go to Settings â†’ Developer Options
4. Tap "Reset Today's Routine"
5. Confirm the action
6. Check that:
   - Loading spinner shows during reset
   - Success alert appears
   - Routine shows as incomplete in Practice tab
   - Can complete methods again

## Console Output

Watch for these console logs:
```
DevelopmentTools: resetTodaysRoutine called
DevelopmentTools: Starting routine reset for user: {userId}
DevelopmentTools: Found selected routine: {routineId}
DevelopmentTools: Found {n} session logs to delete
DevelopmentTools: Successfully deleted session log {id}
DevelopmentTools: Successfully reset today's routine completion (update/create)
```

## If Still Not Working

1. Check Xcode console for error messages
2. Verify Firestore rules allow write access
3. Ensure routine is properly selected
4. Try logging out and back in
5. Check network connectivity

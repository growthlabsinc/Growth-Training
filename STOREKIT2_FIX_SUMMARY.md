# StoreKit2 Production Fix Summary

## Problem
Products not loading in TestFlight because they don't exist in App Store Connect yet.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Fallback UI
- Created `StoreKit2FallbackService.swift` to handle missing products gracefully
- Updated `StoreKit2PaywallView.swift` to show informative message when products unavailable
- Added retry button for users to check again

### 2. App Store Connect Setup Required
You need to create the subscription products in App Store Connect:

**Quick Steps:**
1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Navigate to: My Apps → Growth: Method → Features → In-App Purchases
3. Create 3 auto-renewable subscriptions:
   - Weekly: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.weekly` ($4.99)
   - Quarterly: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.quarterly` ($29.99)
   - Yearly: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.yearly` ($49.99)
4. Create subscription group: "Growth: Method Pro"
5. Add required metadata (localization, screenshots, etc.)
6. Mark as "Ready to Submit"

### 3. Files Modified
- `StoreKit2FallbackService.swift` - New fallback service
- `StoreKit2PaywallView.swift` - Added fallback UI
- `check_app_store_connect_access.sh` - Setup checklist script

## Testing Options

### Immediate Testing (Works Now)
```bash
# Use iOS Simulator
1. Open Xcode
2. Select any iPhone Simulator
3. Run the app
4. Products will load from local StoreKit config
```

### TestFlight Testing (After Setup)
```bash
# After creating products in App Store Connect:
1. Wait 2-24 hours for propagation
2. Upload to TestFlight
3. Products will load from App Store
```

## Current Status
✅ Code is production-ready
✅ Fallback UI prevents crashes
✅ Local testing works in Simulator
⏳ Waiting for App Store Connect product creation
⏳ 2-24 hour propagation time after creation

## Run Checklist
```bash
./check_app_store_connect_access.sh
```

# AICoachService - String Literals and Compilation Fixed

## All String Literal Errors Resolved

### 1. ✅ Fixed Print Statement Quotes
- Removed extra quotes that were left from logger replacement
- Changed `print("[INFO] "text")` to `print("[INFO] text")`
- Changed `print("[ERROR] "text")` to `print("[ERROR] text")`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Single Quotes
- Replaced single quotes with escaped double quotes
- Changed `'generateAIResponse'` to `\"generateAIResponse\"`
- Changed `'text'` to `\"text\"`

### 3. ✅ Added Temporary Type Stubs
Added minimal stub implementations for compilation:
```swift
- PromptTemplateService - Service class with basic methods
- ChatMessage - Message structure
- KnowledgeSource - Knowledge reference
- FeatureAccess - Access control enum
- FeatureUsage - Usage tracking
- FeatureType - Feature identifier
```

## Important Note
These are temporary stubs to allow compilation. The real implementations exist in:
- `Growth/Features/AICoach/Services/PromptTemplateService.swift`
- `Growth/Features/AICoach/Models/ChatMessage.swift`
- `Growth/Core/Models/FeatureAccess.swift`
- `Growth/Core/Models/SubscriptionTier.swift`

## To Complete the Fix
1. Ensure all the actual implementation files are included in the same build target
2. Remove the temporary stub definitions from AICoachService.swift
3. Clean and rebuild the project

## Result
- All string literal errors fixed
- All print statements properly formatted
- Temporary types added for compilation
- File should now compile successfully

# Live Activity Timer Race Condition Fix - Final

## Problem Summary
After multiple pause/resume cycles via Live Activity buttons, the app timer would get stuck in paused state while the Live Activity timer continued running. This was caused by race conditions between Live Activity updates and background restoration logic.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Race Condition in `restoreFromBackground()`
- **Issue**: When Live Activity resumed the timer via Darwin notification, the view's `onAppear` would subsequently call `restoreFromBackground()`
- **Impact**: This would override the correct timer state set by Live Activity
- **Location**: `TimerView.swift:350` and `TimerService.swift:666`

### 2. Incorrect Completion Detection
- **Issue**: After resume, `restoreFromBackground()` was incorrectly determining the timer was complete
- **Impact**: Timer would be forced to paused state even though it should be running
- **Location**: `TimerService.swift:789` (now line 815)

### 3. Missing Guard Against Running State
- **Issue**: `restoreFromBackground()` didn't check if timer was already running
- **Impact**: Would attempt restoration even when Live Activity had already resumed the timer
- **Location**: `TimerService.swift:666`

## Files Modified
1. `TimerService.swift` - Added guards against race conditions and improved completion detection
2. Previously: `LiveActivityManager.swift` - Fixed pause duration accumulation
3. Previously: `TimerActivityAttributes.swift` - Added totalPausedDuration tracking

The race condition between Live Activity updates and background restoration is now fully resolved.

# Story 14.1: Visual Design Refresh - Color, Typography, and Dark Mode

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want the app to have a more sophisticated and modern visual appearance with an updated color scheme, improved typography, and robust dark mode, making it more enjoyable to use.

**Context:**
This story initiates Epic 14, focusing on elevating the Growth app's visual design and user experience. It builds on the existing style guide and theming system, aiming to modernize the app's look and feel by updating color palettes, typography, and ensuring comprehensive dark mode support. This is foundational for all subsequent UI/UX modernization stories in Epic 14.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Color Scheme & Branding:**
  - Implement a refined color palette using gradients instead of flat colors where appropriate.
  - Utilize the green accent color strategically, creating gradients from emerald to teal for key elements.
  - Introduce subtle background textures or patterns to add visual interest, avoiding monotony.
- **Dark Mode:**
  - Implement or thoroughly review and enhance dark mode support across all screens, ensuring proper contrast ratios for readability and aesthetics.
- **Typography & Hierarchy:**
  - Upgrade to SF Pro Display font family for a native iOS feel (if not already in use).
  - Establish a clearer visual hierarchy using varied font weights (e.g., Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold from style guide) and sizes to guide the eye.
  - Ensure important information is consistently larger and bolder.
  - Implement proper spacing between text elements for improved readability throughout the app.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Gradients are tastefully applied to UI elements as per new design guidelines.
- AC2: Green accent gradients (emerald to teal) are used strategically on key interactive elements or branding accents.
- AC3: Subtle background textures/patterns are implemented where they enhance visual appeal without cluttering.
- AC4: Dark mode is fully supported with correct color palettes and contrast ratios on all MVP screens.
- AC5: SF Pro Display (or chosen modern font) is consistently applied.
- AC6: Text hierarchy is clear, with improved use of font weights, sizes, and spacing.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Follow standards in [`docs/style-guide.md`](mdc:docs/style-guide.md) and [`docs/ui-ux-spec.md`](mdc:docs/ui-ux-spec.md). Reference the Figma design for visual cues. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Modify:
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTheme.swift` (theming, gradients, color palette)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppColors.swift`, `ColorExtensions.swift` (color definitions, gradients)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTypography.swift`, `InterFont.swift` (font family, weights)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/Cards/GrowthCard.swift`, `CardView.swift` (card backgrounds, gradients, textures)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/Buttons/PrimaryButtonStyle.swift`, `GrowthButton.swift` (button gradients, typography)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Extensions/Font+Extension.swift`, `UIFont+Extension.swift` (font helpers)
    - All main feature views (e.g., `DashboardView.swift`, `RecommendedRoutineCardView.swift`, etc.) for application of new styles
  - Files to Create:
    - (If needed) `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/BackgroundTextures.swift` (for reusable background patterns)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - SwiftUI (for UI rendering, gradients, dark mode)
  - SF Pro Display font (ensure included and referenced)
  - iOS system dark mode support

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - None specific to this story (UI only)

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Apply gradients using SwiftUI's `LinearGradient` or `RadialGradient` where appropriate (see style guide for color stops).
  - Use green accent gradients (emerald to teal: e.g., #0A5042 to #00BFA5) for primary actions, highlights, and branding.
  - Add subtle background textures/patterns (e.g., using overlays or custom views) to main backgrounds and cards, referencing Figma and style guide.
  - Ensure all text uses SF Pro Display with correct weights and sizes per style guide.
  - Review all screens in both light and dark mode for contrast and readability.
  - Use spacing system from style guide (4pt, 8pt, 16pt, etc.) for text and element separation.

- **Data Structures:**
  - No changes to data models required for this story.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - None required for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in [`docs/style-guide.md`](mdc:docs/style-guide.md) and [`docs/templates/coding-standards.md`](mdc:docs/templates/coding-standards.md).
  - Reference [`docs/ui-ux-spec.md`](mdc:docs/ui-ux-spec.md) for visual/interaction details.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Review and update color palette in `AppColors.swift` and `ColorExtensions.swift` to include gradients and new accent colors.
- [ ] Implement gradient backgrounds and accent gradients in `AppTheme.swift` and apply to key UI elements (buttons, cards, highlights).
- [ ] Add or update background textures/patterns (create `BackgroundTextures.swift` if needed) and apply to main backgrounds and cards.
- [ ] Ensure SF Pro Display is used throughout the app; update `AppTypography.swift`, `InterFont.swift`, and font extensions as needed.
- [ ] Review and update all text styles for hierarchy, weights, and spacing per style guide.
- [ ] Audit and enhance dark mode support in all relevant files, ensuring correct color/contrast on all screens.
- [ ] Update main feature views (e.g., Dashboard, Cards, Buttons) to use new styles, gradients, and typography.
- [ ] Test all changes in both light and dark mode on device and simulator.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/Testing Strategy Documentation.md`](mdc:docs/Testing%20Strategy%20Documentation.md).

- **Unit Tests:**
  - (If applicable) Test color/gradient helpers and typography utilities for correct output.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Visually inspect all screens in both light and dark mode.
  - Confirm gradients, accent colors, and textures are applied as per design.
  - Check that all text uses SF Pro Display with correct weights/sizes.
  - Validate spacing and text hierarchy visually.
  - Use accessibility tools to check contrast ratios in both modes.

# Story 9.4: Progression History & Celebrations

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to view my progression history and receive celebratory feedback when I advance to a new stage, so I can feel a sense of accomplishment and stay motivated on my growth journey.

**Context:** This story builds on the progression capabilities implemented in Stories 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3. Now that users can progress through method stages, we need to provide a clear visualization of their journey and create meaningful celebrations for these milestone achievements. This reinforces the progress users are making and helps maintain engagement with the app.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a progression history view that displays all stage advancements for a given method
- Design and implement an engaging celebration experience when users progress to a new stage
- Add progression history section to user profile and method detail screens
- Track meaningful statistics about user's progression (time spent at each stage, accomplishments)
- Surface progression achievements in the app dashboard as part of the user's growth narrative
- Integrate with the existing affirmation system for stage progression celebrations

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Users can view their entire progression history for any method they have practiced
- AC2: Each progression event displays key information: date, from/to stage, time spent at previous stage
- AC3: When a user progresses to a new stage, they see an engaging celebration animation
- AC4: Celebration experience includes personalized affirmations based on their achievement
- AC5: Method detail view includes a progression timeline showing the user's journey
- AC6: User profile includes statistics about progression across all methods
- AC7: Dashboard highlights recent progression achievements

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards and understand the project structure. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create: 
    - `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/Views/ProgressionHistoryView.swift` - Component for visualizing progression history
    - `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/Views/StageCelebrationView.swift` - Celebration animation and content
    - `Growth/Features/Profile/Views/UserProgressionStatsView.swift` - Statistics in user profile
  
  - Files to Modify:
    - `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/Views/GrowthMethodDetailView.swift` - Add progression history section
    - `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/ViewModels/GrowthMethodDetailViewModel.swift` - Add progression history data
    - `Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/DashboardView.swift` - Add progression highlights
    - `Growth/Core/Services/ProgressionService.swift` - Add history retrieval methods

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Swift & SwiftUI
  - SwiftUI animations for celebrations
  - Combine for reactive updates
  - Firebase/Firestore for progression history

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Firestore queries to retrieve progression history
  - AffirmationService integration for personalized celebrations

- **Data Structures:**

  - Existing `ProgressionEvent` model should be sufficient for core functionality
  - New view models or helper structures for organizing display data:
    ```swift
    struct ProgressionTimelineItem {
        let event: ProgressionEvent
        let durationAtStage: TimeInterval
        let formattedDuration: String
        let achievements: [String]  // Key accomplishments at this stage
    }
    ```

- **Environment Variables:**
  
  - No new environment variables needed

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test progression history retrieval and statistics calculations
  - Verify correct ordering and organization of timeline data
  - Test celebration trigger conditions
  
- **Manual Verification:**
  - Navigate through progression history for different methods
  - Trigger progression celebrations and verify animations
  - Check that dashboard highlights recent progressions
  - Verify timeline displays correctly for various progression patterns

## Implementation Notes

This story focuses on creating an emotionally rewarding experience around progression achievements. Consider these principles:

1. **Visual Impact:** Use animations, transitions, and visual design to create moments of delight when celebrating progression.

2. **Personal Recognition:** Leverage user data to make celebrations feel personalized and meaningful.

3. **Learning Continuity:** Ensure the celebration experience smoothly transitions to introducing the new stage content.

4. **Progressive Disclosure:** For users with extensive progression history, use progressive disclosure patterns to avoid overwhelming them.

5. **Varied Celebration Content:** Create variety in celebration messages and visuals to keep the experience fresh.

The progression history should be more than just a logâ€”it should tell the story of the user's growth journey, highlighting key achievements and time investments. This creates a narrative that reinforces their commitment to personal growth and celebrates their persistence.

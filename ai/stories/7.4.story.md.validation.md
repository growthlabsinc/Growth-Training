**Final Assessment:**

- READY: The story provides sufficient context for implementation

The story clearly explains how the timer functionality should be connected to the session logging feature. It provides detailed information about the files to modify, the expected behavior, and how to handle various timer modes and edge cases. The testing requirements cover both unit testing and manual verification scenarios. The story is self-contained and includes sufficient technical implementation details for developers to implement the feature.

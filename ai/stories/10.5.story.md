# Story 10.5: HIPAA/GDPR Compliance Configuration & Documentation (GCP/Firebase)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As the Organization, we need to ensure our Google Cloud and Firebase setup is configured to support HIPAA/GDPR compliance for relevant user data, and this is documented.

**Context:** Following the implementation of data encryption (Story 10.1), user data deletion mechanisms (Story 10.2), legal documentation (Story 10.3), and App Store guideline compliance review (Story 10.4), we now need to ensure our backend infrastructure is properly configured and documented to support HIPAA/GDPR compliance. This story focuses on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Firebase configuration to handle sensitive health data in compliance with regulatory requirements, which is essential before the app can be released.

## Detailed Requirements

- Sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Google Cloud for all services handling PHI (Protected Health Information). 
- Verify and document which Firebase services (Firestore, Cloud Functions, Firebase Auth if used for PHI) are covered by the BAA.
- For GDPR:
  - Ensure data processing agreements are in place with Google.
  - Configure data storage locations (e.g., Firestore region) to EU if handling EU user data and aiming for data residency.
  - Document how user consent is obtained and managed.
  - Document how data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure - see Story 10.2) will be handled.
- Implement appropriate IAM roles and audit logging on GCP/Firebase.
- Document these configurations and processes in `docs/compliance-config.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: BAA with Google Cloud is in place or process initiated.
- AC2: Firebase/GCP services are configured aligning with HIPAA/GDPR principles (e.g., data regions, audit logs).
- AC3: Data Processing Agreements for GDPR are confirmed.
- AC4: Key compliance configurations and procedures are documented in `docs/compliance-config.md`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create: 
    - `docs/compliance-config.md` (Comprehensive documentation of compliance configurations)
    - `docs/firebase-gdpr-hipaa-guide.md` (Practical guide for maintaining compliance)
    - `Growth/Core/Services/ComplianceConfigurationService.swift` (Optional service to handle compliance-related configurations)
  
  - Files to Modify:
    - `firebase.json` (To specify region settings and security rules)
    - `Growth/App/GrowthApp.swift` (To ensure compliance-related configuration loading)
    - `Growth/Features/Authentication/ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift` (To update consent tracking)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Firebase Admin SDK (for IAM and audit logging configuration)
  - Firebase Security Rules (for secure data access patterns)
  - Google Cloud Console (for BAA and data processing agreements)
  - Swift/SwiftUI (for client-side compliance support)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Firebase Authentication API (user consent tracking)
  - Firestore API (data storage with appropriate security rules)
  - Google Cloud IAM API (for role management)
  - Google Cloud Audit Logging API (for compliance monitoring)

- **Data Structures:**

  - Data Classification Schema (PHI vs non-PHI data)
  - Consent Tracking Model (user consent records)
  - Audit Log Schema (security event tracking)

- **Environment Variables:**

  - `FIREBASE_REGION` (EU regions for GDPR compliance if applicable)
  - `ENABLE_ENHANCED_SECURITY_LOGGING` (For HIPAA audit requirements)

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Special attention to secure coding practices for health data
  - Follow Firebase best practices for PHI handling
  - Ensure secure transmission and storage of all health-related data

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Configuration Testing:**
  - Verify Firebase project region settings match compliance requirements
  - Confirm IAM roles enforce proper access controls
  - Test audit logging captures all required events
  
- **Security Testing:**
  - Verify Firestore security rules properly protect PHI
  - Test data access is properly restricted by roles
  - Confirm encryption is applied to all sensitive data
  
- **Compliance Verification:**
  - Review BAA documentation for completeness
  - Verify GDPR data subject rights are technically supported
  - Confirm consent tracking mechanisms work correctly
  
- **Documentation Review:**
  - Ensure `docs/compliance-config.md` addresses all requirements
  - Verify technical documentation is clear and actionable
  - Confirm all compliance processes are well-documented

## Notes

- The configuration should be future-proof to accommodate potential regulatory changes
- Consider consulting with a compliance specialist to review the configuration
- Document any decisions made regarding regulatory compliance for future reference
- Ensure the development team understands the compliance requirements and how they affect development choices
- This story primarily focuses on the configuration and documentation, building upon the technical implementations from previous stories

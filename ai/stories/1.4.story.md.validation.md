# Story 1.4 Validation: Style Guide Implementation - Core UI Elements

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

- [x] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [x] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [x] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [x] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (Stories 1.1-1.3)
- [x] Business context and value are clear (consistent UI foundation for the app)

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

- [x] Key files to create/modify are identified
- [x] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned (UIKit, Swift extensions, Core Graphics)
- [x] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [x] Necessary data structures are referenced (enums for type-safe access)
- [x] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

- [x] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections (style-guide.md)
- [x] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (project structure)
- [x] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [x] References use consistent format

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

- [x] Core information needed is included (detailed component specifications)
- [x] Implicit assumptions are made explicit (dark mode support requirements)
- [x] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [x] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed (component states)

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

- [x] Required testing approach is outlined
- [x] Key test scenarios are identified (unit tests, UI tests, manual verification)
- [x] Success criteria are defined (matching style guide specifications)
- [x] Special testing considerations are noted (dark mode testing, device compatibility)

**Final Assessment:**

- READY: The story provides sufficient context for implementation
  
The story contains comprehensive guidance for implementing the core UI components according to the style guide. All necessary details about component specifications, file structure, and testing requirements are clearly defined, making it ready for implementation.

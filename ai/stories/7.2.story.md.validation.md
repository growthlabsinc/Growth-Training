# Validation: Story 7.2: Method-Specific Timer Configuration (Countdown & Intervals)

**Status:** DRAFTED

## Validation Summary

Story 7.2 has been drafted according to the project requirements. The draft includes all necessary components:

1. ✅ Clear User Story with appropriate Goal & Context
2. ✅ Detailed Requirements aligned with Epic 7 specifications
3. ✅ Acceptance Criteria that are testable and complete
4. ✅ Technical Implementation Context with:
   - ✅ Relevant files to create/modify
   - ✅ Key technologies 
   - ✅ Implementation notes
   - ✅ Data model extensions
5. ✅ Complete Tasks/Subtasks breakdown
6. ✅ Testing Requirements covering:
   - ✅ Unit testing
   - ✅ Integration testing
   - ✅ Manual testing
   - ✅ Edge cases

## Alignment with Epic 7

This story aligns with the second component of Epic 7 as outlined in `docs/epic7.md`. It focuses specifically on extending the basic timer functionality from Story 7.1 to support method-specific configurations, including countdown timers and intervals with transitions.

The draft addresses all requirements specified in the epic for Story 7.2:
- Extending the GrowthMethod data model with timer configurations
- Supporting countdown timers based on recommended durations
- Implementing interval-based timing with named phases
- Providing alerts for interval transitions and completion
- Default behavior when no configuration is specified

## Technical Completeness

The technical implementation details provide sufficient guidance for developers to implement the feature, including:

- Clear structure for the data model extensions
- Specific enhancements needed in the TimerService
- Approach for UI components to display intervals
- Sound and haptic feedback implementation
- Integration with Method Detail screens
- Background mode considerations

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

The story correctly identifies:
- Dependency on Story 7.1 (basic timer functionality)
- Needs for GrowthMethod model extension
- Integration with existing Firestore data
- Sound/haptic feedback components

## Questions and Clarifications

No outstanding questions or issues have been identified. The draft appears ready for implementation.

A potential consideration that might be worth discussing before implementation:
- How should the UI handle very long interval sessions (10+ intervals)? Should it show a count or all intervals?
- Should intervals have the ability to be skipped or repeated by the user?

## Ready for Development

This story can proceed to development without further modifications. The level of detail provided is appropriate for the complexity of the task, with clear guidance on implementation approach while allowing developers flexibility in the specific implementation details.

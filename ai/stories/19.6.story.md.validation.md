**Final Assessment:** READY - The story provides sufficient context for implementation

The story is well-structured and provides comprehensive guidance for implementing the onboarding flow orchestration and interactive elements. It clearly identifies the files to create and modify, specifies the exact UI/UX requirements including colors and animation timings, and provides thorough testing guidance. The story successfully builds upon the previous onboarding stories while adding the polish layer needed for a professional user experience.

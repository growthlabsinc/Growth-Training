**Final Assessment:** READY

**Notes for Developer Agent:**
- Prerequisite stories 4.1 (Manual Session Logging) and 4.2 (Session History List View) are currently in "Draft" status. Story 4.3 depends on 4.2 for navigation and data. This should be resolved before or during the implementation of 4.3.
- Verify the existence and exact name of `SessionViewModel.swift`. If it doesn't exist, deletion logic might need to be incorporated directly into `SessionDetailView` or `SessionHistoryView`, or a new ViewModel created for session management.

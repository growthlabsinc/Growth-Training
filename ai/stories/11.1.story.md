# Story 11.1: Dashboard Screen Structure & Layout

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:**
As an iOS Developer, I want to implement the basic structure and layout for the Dashboard/Home tab's view controller, adhering to the UI/UX specification and style guide.

**Context:**
This story initiates the implementation of the main Dashboard/Home screen, replacing the placeholder view controller from Epic 1. The Dashboard will serve as the user's personalized home, providing an overview of their current status, quick access to key actions, and motivational elements. This foundational layout will enable the integration of additional dashboard features in subsequent stories of Epic 11.

## Detailed Requirements

- Replace the placeholder view controller created in Epic 1 for the Dashboard tab with a functional view controller.
- Implement the overall layout as defined in the wireframes/mockups and UI/UX Spec IA:
  - Section for Current Stage/Next Session Summary.
  - Section for Quick Log Access.
  - Section for Motivational Snippet/Tip.
  - Section for Streak/Badge Highlights.
- Use placeholder content for each section (to be replaced in later stories).
- Ensure the layout adapts correctly to different iPhone screen sizes (responsive design).
- Adhere strictly to `docs/style-guide.md` for fonts, colors, and spacing.
- Use SwiftUI best practices and MVVM architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A dedicated view controller (SwiftUI View) exists for the Dashboard tab.
- AC2: The basic layout structure with placeholders for different sections is implemented.
- AC3: Layout adheres to the style guide and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technical Implementation Context

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/DashboardView.swift`
  - Files to Modify: `Growth/MainView.swift` (replace DashboardPlaceholderView with DashboardView in the tab bar)
- **Key Technologies:**
  - SwiftUI for UI and layout
  - App color and font assets (see `Assets.xcassets` and `Resources/Fonts`)
- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Follow the structure and spacing from the UI/UX spec and Figma mockups (if available)
  - Use rounded cards/containers for each section
  - Use placeholder text/icons for now
  - Ensure accessibility (labels, contrast)
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`
  - Use MVVM pattern for view/viewmodel separation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create `DashboardView.swift` with the required layout and placeholder sections
- [ ] Replace `DashboardPlaceholderView` with `DashboardView` in `MainView.swift`
- [ ] Style all sections according to the style guide (fonts, colors, spacing)
- [ ] Ensure layout is responsive on all supported iPhone sizes
- [ ] Add SwiftUI preview for `DashboardView`
- [ ] Add comments/TODOs for where future features will be integrated

## Testing Requirements

- **UI Tests:**
  - Verify that all placeholder sections are visible and correctly laid out
  - Test layout on multiple device sizes and in both light/dark mode
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Confirm that the Dashboard tab displays the new layout and not the old placeholder

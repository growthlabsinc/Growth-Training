# Story 8.6: Journaling Prompts

## Goal

**User Story:** As a User, I want to be offered occasional journaling prompts related to my journey and experience, so I can reflect more deeply, with these notes integrated into my session logs.

## Description

This story implements journaling prompts that encourage users to reflect on their practice sessions. Rather than creating an entirely separate journaling feature, these prompts will enhance the existing session notes functionality by providing thoughtful questions that inspire deeper reflection during session logging.

## Requirements

1. Create a collection of reflection-oriented journaling prompts (5-10 minimum)
2. Implement a system to display a relevant prompt when users are adding notes to their session logs
3. Prompts should be contextual when possible (e.g., based on session type, user progress, etc.)
4. Ensure the prompts are optional and don't hinder the normal note-taking process
5. Allow users to easily ignore prompts if they prefer free-form notes

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: A pool of at least 5-10 journaling prompts is available in the app
- AC2: A relevant prompt is optionally displayed within the session logging interface when adding notes
- AC3: User can ignore the prompt and write free-form notes as usual

## Technical Notes

### Data Structure

- Create a new `JournalingPrompt` model with the following properties:
  - `id`: String - Unique identifier
  - `text`: String - The prompt text
  - `category`: PromptCategory - Category enum to help with context-appropriate prompts

```swift
enum PromptCategory: String, Codable, CaseIterable {
    case general
    case reflection
    case progress
    case goals
    case challenges
}

struct JournalingPrompt: Identifiable, Codable, Equatable, Hashable {
    let id: String
    let text: String
    let category: PromptCategory
}
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Prompt Service**
   - Create `JournalingPromptService` class to manage prompts
   - Functions to get random or relevant prompts by category
   - Initial pool of prompts loaded from app bundle

2. **UI Integration**
   - Enhance the notes section in `LogSessionView` to display optional prompts
   - Add a subtle prompt display with the ability to refresh/change prompts
   - Design a non-intrusive UI that doesn't interfere with regular note-taking

3. **Integration Points**
   - `LogSessionView`: Main integration point in the notes section
   - `LogSessionViewModel`: Logic to fetch and manage relevant prompts

## Sample Prompts

### General
1. "What was the most rewarding part of today's session?"
2. "What would you like to remember about this practice?"
3. "How might you apply what you practiced today in other areas of your life?"

### Reflection
1. "What did you notice about your thoughts or emotions during this session?"
2. "How did this session compare to your previous ones?"
3. "What insights or realizations did you have during this practice?"

### Progress
1. "What improvements have you noticed since you started this practice?"
2. "What aspect of your practice feels most comfortable now that was once challenging?"
3. "How has your understanding of this method deepened over time?"

### Goals
1. "What would you like to focus on in your next session?"
2. "What small goal could you set for tomorrow's practice?"
3. "How does today's session bring you closer to your overall goals?"

### Challenges
1. "What was challenging about today's session, and how did you work through it?"
2. "What might help you overcome any obstacles you encountered today?"
3. "If you faced resistance during this session, what helped you continue?"

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `JournalingPrompt` model and `PromptCategory` enum
2. Implement `JournalingPromptService` with methods to retrieve appropriate prompts
3. Update `LogSessionView` to display optional prompts in the notes section
4. Update `LogSessionViewModel` to fetch and manage relevant prompts
5. Test the integration to ensure prompts are helpful but not intrusive

## Testing Notes

- Verify prompts display correctly in the session logging interface
- Confirm users can easily ignore prompts if they prefer
- Test that focusing on the TextEditor field doesn't cause layout issues with the prompt
- Ensure appropriate category-specific prompts are shown based on context
- Verify that the feature remains optional and doesn't force users to follow the prompts

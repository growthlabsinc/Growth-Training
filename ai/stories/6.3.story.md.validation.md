# Validation: Story 6.3 - AI Coach Disclaimer Presentation

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

- [x] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [x] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [x] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [x] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (if applicable)
- [x] Business context and value are clear

**Notes:** The story clearly identifies its purpose as adding disclaimers to the AI Coach interface. It explicitly states its relationship to Epic 6 and mentions dependencies on Stories 6.1 and 6.2. The business value (setting user expectations, ethical AI usage, and liability concerns) is well defined.

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

- [x] Key files to create/modify are identified (not necessarily exhaustive)
- [x] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [x] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [x] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [x] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable)
- [x] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

**Notes:** The story identifies files to create and modify, specifies SwiftUI and UserDefaults as key technologies, and outlines the data structure additions needed in the ViewModel. No environment variables are required for this story, and it follows standard patterns.

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

- [x] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [x] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (not just referenced)
- [x] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [x] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md#section`)

**Notes:** References to coding standards and project structure are appropriately provided. The story summarizes the relevant context from Stories 6.1 and 6.2 rather than just referencing them. References use consistent format.

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

- [x] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [x] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [x] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [x] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

**Notes:** The story contains the necessary information for implementation without requiring excessive external document consultation. The story makes explicit that the disclaimer needs to be shown on first launch but not on subsequent launches (tracked in UserDefaults).

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

- [x] Required testing approach is outlined
- [x] Key test scenarios are identified
- [x] Success criteria are defined
- [x] Special testing considerations are noted (if applicable)

**Notes:** Testing guidance is thorough, covering unit tests, integration tests, manual testing, and accessibility testing. Specific scenarios are identified, such as first launch vs. subsequent launches and testing the info icon functionality.

| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS   | None                                      |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS   | None                                      |

**Final Assessment:** READY

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the goal, requirements, technical implementation details, and testing guidelines. The story is self-contained while still making appropriate references to external documentation. A developer agent should have all the necessary information to implement the AI Coach disclaimer presentation feature successfully.

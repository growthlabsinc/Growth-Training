# Story 17.1: Develop Consolidated Progress Overview Dashboard

**Status:** Complete

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want a single, consolidated "Progress" section where I can get a comprehensive overview of my journey, including my calendar, stats, and achievements, without navigating to multiple places.

**Context:** This story initiates Epic 17 by creating the foundation for unified progress visualization. Building upon existing progress tracking in the current ProgressTabView, this story consolidates scattered progress data into a cohesive overview dashboard that serves as the entry point for all progress-related functionality.

## Detailed Requirements

- Design and implement the new "Progress" tab's main screen as an "Overview Dashboard."
- This dashboard should synthesize key information from previously separate views:
  - A summarized calendar view (e.g., monthly, showing workout intensity).
  - Key performance statistics (e.g., total sessions, total time, average intensity).
  - Highlights of recent achievements or progress towards current achievements.
  - Routine adherence percentage (from Story 17.2).
- Ensure information is presented in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The "Progress" tab features a new Overview Dashboard consolidating calendar, stats, and achievement highlights.
- AC2: The dashboard provides a clear, single-glance understanding of overall progress.
- AC3: Data from different progress tracking aspects is presented cohesively.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create: 
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Views/ProgressOverviewView.swift` (Main overview dashboard)
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Components/ProgressSummaryCard.swift` (Reusable summary card component)
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Components/CalendarSummaryView.swift` (Condensed calendar view)
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Components/StatsHighlightView.swift` (Key statistics display)
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Components/AchievementHighlightView.swift` (Achievement showcase)
  - Files to Modify: 
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Views/ProgressTabView.swift` (Update to use new overview as entry point)
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/ViewModels/ProgressViewModel.swift` (Add overview data aggregation)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - SwiftUI for declarative UI components
  - MVVM pattern with ObservableObject for state management
  - Core Data integration for progress data retrieval
  - AppTheme.Typography for consistent Gravity font usage

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - FirestoreService for session log data retrieval
  - UserService for user progress metrics
  - Local Core Data for cached progress information

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Follow the "calm, professional, supportive, discreet, icon-forward" design principles from UI/UX spec
  - Use AppTheme color palette: GrowthGreen, BrightTeal, MintGreen, PaleGreen
  - Implement card-based layout similar to existing DashboardView components
  - Ensure accessibility with proper VoiceOver labels and Dynamic Type support

- **Data Structures:**

  - `ProgressOverviewData`: Aggregate data structure containing summary metrics
  - `CalendarSummaryItem`: Representation of daily/weekly activity summaries
  - `StatisticHighlight`: Key performance metrics for display
  - `AchievementHighlight`: Recent or upcoming achievement data

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None specific to this story - uses existing Firebase configuration

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`
  - Use AppTheme.Typography for all text styling
  - Implement proper error handling and loading states
  - Ensure components are modular and reusable

# Story 11.5: Integrate Motivational Affirmations Display

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to integrate the motivational affirmation display component (logic from Epic 8, Story 8.5) into the Dashboard layout.

**Context:**
This story builds upon the Dashboard structure and gamification elements (Stories 11.1â€“11.4). The goal is to display a random motivational affirmation from a predefined pool in the Dashboard's designated section, providing users with supportive, effort-based encouragement. The logic and requirements for affirmations are defined in Epic 8, Story 8.5. The display must be visually consistent with the UI/UX spec and style guide, and should only show affirmations occasionally to avoid overexposure.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement the logic to occasionally display a random affirmation from the predefined pool in the designated dashboard section.
- Ensure the text is displayed clearly and adheres to the style guide.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A motivational affirmation is displayed occasionally on the Dashboard.
- AC2: The text presentation adheres to the style guide.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Follow project standards in [coding-standards.md](mdc:docs/coding-standards.md) and [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/project-structure.md). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Modify: [Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/DashboardView.swift](mdc:Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/DashboardView.swift)
  - (If needed) Add/modify supporting files for storing or retrieving the affirmation pool

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Swift, SwiftUI

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Use a local or remote (e.g., Firestore or bundled JSON) pool of 10-15 positive affirmations (see [epic8.md](mdc:docs/epic8.md#story-85-effort-based-affirmations--encouraging-messages))
  - Display a random affirmation on Dashboard load, and/or after session log or streak/badge event

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - The affirmation display should use the correct font, color, and spacing per [style-guide.md](mdc:docs/style-guide.md) and [ui-ux-spec.md](mdc:docs/ui-ux-spec.md)
  - Text should be short, supportive, and visually distinct but not overwhelming
  - Layout and spacing must match the Dashboard section in the Figma

- **Data Structures:**
  - Affirmations: Array of strings, either bundled in the app or fetched from Firestore/remote config

- **Environment Variables:**
  - None required unless fetching affirmations from a remote source

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in [coding-standards.md](mdc:docs/coding-standards.md)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Define or fetch a pool of 10-15 positive affirmations (local or remote)
- [ ] Implement logic to display a random affirmation occasionally on the Dashboard
- [ ] Style the affirmation display per the style guide and Figma (font, color, spacing)
- [ ] Ensure the display is accessible (VoiceOver, contrast, etc.)
- [ ] Add tests for affirmation selection and display logic

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [testing-strategy.md](mdc:docs/testing-strategy.md).

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test random selection logic for affirmations
  - Test that the display logic only shows affirmations occasionally
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Verify that affirmations are displayed on Dashboard load and/or after session log/streak/badge event
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Confirm UI matches Figma and style guide (font, color, spacing)
  - Test accessibility (VoiceOver reads affirmation text)

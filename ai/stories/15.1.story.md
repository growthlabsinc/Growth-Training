# Story 15.1: Implement Revised Information Architecture (IA)

**Status:** Completed

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want a clear and intuitive app structure with new sections for "Routines" and consolidated "Practice" and "Progress" areas, making it easier to navigate and understand the app's offerings.

**Context:** This story begins the implementation of the updated UI/UX Integration Plan by restructuring the app's main navigation and information architecture. This foundational change will support the new user flow where routines become a central organizing principle, and practice entry points are unified. This work builds upon the existing app infrastructure established in previous epics.

## Detailed Requirements

- Restructure the app's main navigation (bottom tab bar) to reflect the new IA:
  - **Home (Dashboard - Redesigned):** Focus on "Today's Focus" and "Weekly Progress Snapshot."
  - **Routines (New Section):** Current Routine, Browse Routines, Routine History.
  - **Practice (Unified Section):** Entry point for Guided Sessions (from routine) and Quick Practice (ad-hoc), leading to Timer & Logging.
  - **Progress (Consolidated Section):** Overview Dashboard, Calendar View, Statistics, Achievements.
  - **Profile:** (Implicitly retained from previous IA, ensure it's still accessible, e.g., containing Settings, Session History, Personal Stats as per previous plan).
- Migrate existing content and features to their new locations within this IA.
- Update all internal routing and deep links.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The app's main navigation is updated to the new IA structure including Home (Dashboard), Routines, Practice, Progress, and Profile.
- AC2: The new "Routines" section is implemented with placeholders for its sub-sections (Current, Browse, History).
- AC3: The "Practice" section serves as a unified entry point for both routine-based and ad-hoc sessions.
- AC4: The "Progress" section is structured with placeholders for its consolidated views.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create: 
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Routines/Views/RoutinesTabView.swift`
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Routines/Views/CurrentRoutineView.swift`
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Routines/Views/BrowseRoutinesView.swift`
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Routines/Views/RoutineHistoryView.swift`
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Practice/Views/PracticeTabView.swift`
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Progress/Views/ProgressTabView.swift`
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Progress/Views/ProgressOverviewView.swift`
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Progress/Views/AchievementsView.swift`
    
  - Files to Modify: 
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/MainView.swift` (update tab structure)
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/DashboardView.swift` (will be redesigned in Story 15.2, but ensure it exists)
    - `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Profile/Views/ProfileView.swift` (ensure it remains accessible)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - SwiftUI for UI implementation
  - SwiftUI's TabView for bottom navigation
  - NavigationStack/NavigationView for internal navigation within each tab
  - @StateObject/@ObservedObject for view model integration

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - No new API interactions required for this story
  - Existing Firebase services will continue to be used as-is

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Maintain consistent visual design with existing app theme (AppTheme)
  - Use SF Symbols for tab bar icons:
    - Home: "house.fill"
    - Routines: "list.bullet.rectangle"
    - Practice: "play.circle.fill"
    - Progress: "chart.line.uptrend.xyaxis"
    - Profile: "person.circle.fill"
  - Ensure smooth transitions between tabs
  - Placeholder views should indicate "Coming Soon" or similar messaging

- **Data Structures:**

  - No new data models required for this story
  - Existing models (User, GrowthMethod, SessionLog, etc.) remain unchanged

- **Environment Variables:**

  - No new environment variables needed for this story

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow SwiftUI best practices for view composition
  - Use clear, descriptive names for new views
  - Implement proper view hierarchy with appropriate use of extracted subviews
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`

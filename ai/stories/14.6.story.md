# Story 14.6: Enhanced Progress Feedback & Interactive Visualizations

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want more engaging and interactive progress visualizations that provide meaningful feedback on my practice journey, helping me stay motivated and understand my progress over time.

**Context:**
This story continues the UI modernization effort of Epic 14, building on the previous visual design refresh (14.1-14.2), navigation improvements (14.3), and streak tracking enhancements (14.4-14.5). It focuses on upgrading the Progress section with interactive, data-rich visualizations that help users understand their growth journey more intuitively. The goal is to provide meaningful feedback that keeps users engaged and motivated by making progress visible and actionable.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Interactive Progress Timeline:**
  - Create an interactive timeline visualization showing practice frequency, duration, and consistency.
  - Implement swipeable time ranges (week, month, quarter, year views).
  - Add animated transitions between different time ranges.
  - Include visual indicators for milestones and achievements on the timeline.
  
- **Statistical Insights:**
  - Design compact statistical cards highlighting key metrics (average session duration, frequency, total practice time).
  - Create trend indicators showing improvement or decline with appropriate styling (up/down arrows, colors).
  - Implement "tap to expand" functionality revealing detailed breakdown of metrics.
  - Add contextual comparison to previous periods (e.g., "15% increase from last month").

- **Heatmap Visualization:**
  - Implement a heatmap visualization showing practice intensity across weekdays/hours.
  - Use color gradients to indicate practice frequency or duration.
  - Add tooltips/detail views when tapping specific cells.
  - Include time-of-day insights to help users identify optimal practice patterns.

- **User Experience Enhancements:**
  - Add subtle micro-animations for state changes and interactions.
  - Implement haptic feedback for important interactions.
  - Ensure all visualizations have appropriate accessibility labels and support.
  - Design empty/zero states with actionable guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Progress screen includes an interactive timeline with multiple time range options.
- AC2: Statistical insight cards show key metrics with trend indicators.
- AC3: Heatmap visualization displays practice patterns across days/times.
- AC4: All visualizations include appropriate animations and transitions.
- AC5: Interactions provide appropriate haptic feedback.
- AC6: All visualizations function correctly in both light and dark mode.
- AC7: All visualizations include proper accessibility support.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Follow standards in [`docs/style-guide.md`](mdc:docs/style-guide.md) and [`docs/ui-ux-spec.md`](mdc:docs/ui-ux-spec.md). Reference the Figma design for visual cues. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Modify:
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Views/ProgressView.swift` (main progress screen)
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/ViewModels/ProgressViewModel.swift` (data handling)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTheme.swift` (for consistent styling)
  - Files to Create:
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/ProgressTimelineView.swift` (interactive timeline)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/StatInsightCard.swift` (statistical insights)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/PracticeHeatmapView.swift` (heatmap visualization)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/TimeRangeSelector.swift` (time range controls)
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Models/ProgressTimelineData.swift` (timeline data model)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - SwiftUI (for UI components and animations)
  - Combine (for reactive data updates)
  - CoreHaptics (for haptic feedback)
  - Swift Charts (for timeline and heatmap visualizations)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Firebase Firestore (to fetch session logs for visualization)
  - UIImpactFeedbackGenerator (for haptic feedback)

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Timeline Styling:
    - Height: 160-180pt
    - Interactive points: 12-15pt touch targets
    - Color coding: Green gradient for sessions, with intensity based on duration
    - Animations: Use `.animation(.spring())` for transitions between time ranges
  - Statistical Cards:
    - Size: ~90pt x 110pt
    - Layout: Grid of 2x2 or horizontal scroll
    - Trend indicators: Small arrows with +/-% change
    - Colors: Green for positive trends, amber/red for negative
  - Heatmap:
    - Cell size: 28-32pt
    - Color gradient: 5-step gradient from light to dark green
    - Day labels: Standard day abbreviations (Mon, Tue, etc.)
    - Time labels: 3-hour blocks (6am, 9am, etc.)
  - Micro-animations:
    - Card expansion: `.animation(.spring())`
    - Timeline transitions: `.animation(.easeInOut)`
    - Tap feedback: `.scaleEffect(0.97)` + haptic

- **Data Structures:**
  - ProgressTimelineData (new model):
    - Aggregated practice data by time periods
    - Statistical information (averages, trends)
    - Milestone markers with dates
  - TimeRange enum (new):
    - Cases for different time ranges (week, month, quarter, year)
    - Helper methods for date calculations

- **Environment Variables:**
  - None required for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in [`docs/style-guide.md`](mdc:docs/style-guide.md) and [`docs/templates/coding-standards.md`](mdc:docs/templates/coding-standards.md).
  - Reference [`docs/ui-ux-spec.md`](mdc:docs/ui-ux-spec.md) for visual/interaction details.

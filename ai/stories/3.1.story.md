# Story 3.1: Methods Overview Screen (Dashboard-Style Cards)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:**  
As a User, I want to see an overview of all available Growth Method stages on a dedicated screen, so I can easily understand the progression and select a method to learn about.

**Context:**  
This story is the first in Epic 3, following the completion of the onboarding and authentication flow (Epic 2). After users complete onboarding and land on the main dashboard, they should be able to access a "Methods" screen that visually presents all Growth Method stages (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Elite) as grouped, tappable cards. This screen serves as the entry point for exploring the app's core instructional content.

## Detailed Requirements

- Design and implement a "Methods" screen that displays Growth Methods grouped by stage (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Elite).
- Each method/stage should be represented by a "Method Card" (as per `docs/style-guide.md` and `docs/ui-ux-spec.md`).
- Method Card should display:
  - Method Name / Stage Name
  - Short Description
  - Placeholder for a visual/icon representing the method/stage.
  - (Future: User's current progress bar for that method/stage - placeholder for now).
- Fetch method/stage data from Firestore (`growthMethods` collection).
- Cards should be tappable to navigate to the Method Detail Screen.
- UI should follow `docs/style-guide.md` and `docs/ui-ux-spec.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Methods Overview screen displays all seeded Growth Methods from Firestore, grouped by stage.
- AC2: Each method is presented as a tappable card with the specified information (name, short description, visual placeholder).
- AC3: Tapping a Method Card navigates to the (placeholder initially) Method Detail Screen, passing the selected method's ID.
- AC4: Screen is scrollable if content exceeds view.
- AC5: UI adheres to the style guide, including light/dark mode.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:  
    - `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/Views/MethodsOverviewView.swift`  
    - (If not present) `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/ViewModels/GrowthMethodsViewModel.swift`
  - Files to Modify:  
    - `Growth/MainView.swift` (to add navigation/tab to MethodsOverviewView)
    - `Growth/Core/Services/FirestoreService.swift` (if Firestore access needs updating)
    - `docs/ui-ux-spec.md` (if new UI patterns are introduced)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - SwiftUI (for UI and navigation)
  - Firestore SDK (for fetching method data)
  - App color and font assets (see `Assets.xcassets` and `Resources/Fonts`)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Read from Firestore collection: `growthMethods`
  - Data model: Each method should have at least `id`, `stage`, `name`, `shortDescription`, and (optionally) `iconName` or image URL.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Cards must be visually distinct, grouped by stage, and tappable.
  - Use rounded corners, drop shadows, and app color palette.
  - Placeholder visuals/icons should be used if no image is available.
  - Support both light and dark mode.
  - Follow spacing, font, and color guidelines in `docs/style-guide.md` and `docs/ui-ux-spec.md`.

- **Data Structures:**
  - Growth Method model (see or define in `data-models.md`):
    ```swift
    struct GrowthMethod: Identifiable {
      let id: String
      let stage: String
      let name: String
      let shortDescription: String
      let iconName: String? // or imageURL: String?
    }
    ```

- **Environment Variables:**
  - Firestore configuration (already set up in environment; no new variables expected for this story)

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`
  - Use MVVM pattern for view/viewmodel separation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create/Update `GrowthMethodsViewModel` to fetch and group methods by stage from Firestore.
- [ ] Implement `MethodsOverviewView` to display grouped method cards.
- [ ] Design and style method cards per UI/UX spec.
- [ ] Add navigation from MainView (tab or button) to MethodsOverviewView.
- [ ] Implement tap action to navigate to Method Detail Screen (can be a placeholder for now).
- [ ] Ensure scrollability and responsiveness on all device sizes.
- [ ] Test with both light and dark mode.
- [ ] Write/Update unit and UI tests for the Methods Overview screen.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**  
  - Test that GrowthMethodsViewModel correctly fetches and groups methods.
- **UI Tests:**  
  - Test that all method cards are displayed and tappable.
  - Test navigation to the detail screen.
  - Test layout in light and dark mode, and on various device sizes.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**  
  - Verify that seeded methods appear as expected in the UI.

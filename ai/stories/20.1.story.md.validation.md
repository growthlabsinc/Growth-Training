  - AppTourStep model, User model extension
- [x] Required environment variables are listed
  - N/A for this story
- [x] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

- [x] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed
  - App backgrounding, navigation interruptions, offline scenarios

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

## Alignment with Epic 6

This story aligns correctly with Epic 6, specifically focusing on the knowledge base creation requirements outlined in the epic. It properly references the existing Growth Method content (Epic 3) and Educational Resources content (Epic 5) as data sources.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

This story has dependencies on previous epics:
- Epic 3 (Growth Methods) - as content source
- Epic 5 (Educational Resources) - as content source

There are no blocking dependencies on previous stories in Epic 6, though conceptually it builds upon the prior stories (6.1-6.4) by providing the content that the AI will reference.

## Technical Feasibility Assessment

The technical approach is feasible, utilizing:
- Google Cloud's Vertex AI Search for the knowledge base
- Firestore as the data source
- Node.js scripts for extraction and ingestion

The story correctly references the existing documentation in `docs/ai-coach-knowledge-base.md` for schema guidance.

## Readiness Checklist

- ✅ Story is appropriately sized for a single sprint
- ✅ Requirements are clear and actionable
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are testable
- ✅ Technical details are sufficient for implementation
- ✅ Dependencies are clearly identified
- ✅ Tasks and subtasks are logically sequenced

## Next Steps

The story is ready for review by the technical team and product manager. After approval, it can be scheduled for implementation in an upcoming sprint.

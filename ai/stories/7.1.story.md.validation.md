- Clear file structure and organization
- Specific technologies to use (Timer class, Date comparisons)
- Background mode implementation strategies
- State management approach
- Extension points for future stories

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

The story correctly identifies:
- Dependencies on foundational UI components from Epic 1
- No direct dependencies on other stories within Epic 7
- Future integration points with Stories 7.2 and 7.4

## Questions and Clarifications

# Story 3.2: Method Detail Screen â€“ Structure & Content Display

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to view detailed information and instructions for a selected Growth Method, so I can understand how to perform it correctly and safely.

**Context:**
This story builds on the Methods Overview screen (Story 3.1) by providing a dedicated Method Detail screen. When a user selects a method card, they are navigated to this screen, which fetches and displays all relevant instructional content, safety information, and equipment requirements for the selected method. The screen must be clear, readable, and adhere to the style guide and UI/UX spec. Visuals/animations are placeholders for now, but the structure should support future enhancements. A CTA for the in-app timer is present but non-functional until a later epic.

## Detailed Requirements

- Design and implement a "Method Detail" screen.
- Screen should receive a `methodId` and fetch corresponding data from Firestore.
- Display:
  - Method Title.
  - Full Description.
  - Detailed step-by-step instructions (text-based for MVP).
  - Information on required tools/equipment for the method.
  - Prominent safety notices and medical disclaimers specific to the method or generally applicable (content to be provided).
  - Placeholder for instructional visuals/animations (e.g., an image view or a note "Visuals coming soon").
- Clear navigation back to the Methods Overview screen.
- CTA to access the "In-App Exercise Timer" for this method (functionality in a later Epic).
- UI should follow `docs/style-guide.md` and `docs/ui-ux-spec.md`, focusing on readability and clarity.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Method Detail screen correctly displays all specified information for a selected method fetched from Firestore.
- AC2: Instructional text is well-formatted and easy to read.
- AC3: Safety notices and disclaimers are prominently displayed.
- AC4: Placeholders for visuals are present.
- AC5: CTA for the timer is present (though non-functional until timer epic).
- AC6: User can navigate back to the Methods Overview screen.

# Story 11.2: Display Current Stage / Next Session Summary

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:**
As a User, I want to see a summary of my current Growth Method stage or a suggestion for my next session on the dashboard, so I know where I stand.

**Context:**
This story builds on the Dashboard structure from Story 11.1 by implementing the "Current Stage / Next Session Summary" section. It will fetch and display the user's current focused Growth Method/Stage from their Firestore profile, and provide a CTA to view the current method or start the next session. This feature helps users quickly understand their progress and what to do next.

## Detailed Requirements

- Fetch the user's "current focused stage" (from Epic 9, Story 9.4) from their Firestore profile.
- Display the name of the current focused Growth Method/Stage in the dashboard's summary section.
- Include a CTA button like "View Current Method" or "Start Next Session" that navigates to the relevant Method Detail screen (Epic 3) or Timer screen (Epic 7).
- Fetch and display the readiness suggestion status (from Epic 9, Story 9.2) if available (e.g., "Ready to Consider Next Stage").
- If no focus stage is set yet, display a prompt to select one (e.g., "Select your current method to get started").
- Ensure the UI matches the style guide and is responsive.
- Use placeholder/mock data if Firestore integration is not yet available, but structure code for easy integration.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The user's current focused Growth Method/Stage name is displayed in the dashboard summary section.
- AC2: A relevant CTA navigates to the Method Detail or Timer screen.
- AC3: The readiness suggestion status is displayed if calculated.
- AC4: If no focus stage is set yet, a prompt to select one is shown.

## Technical Implementation Context

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Modify: `Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/DashboardView.swift` (implement logic in the summary card)
  - Files to Reference: `Growth/Core/Models/GrowthMethod.swift`, Firestore user profile model, navigation logic for Method Detail/Timer
- **Key Technologies:**
  - SwiftUI for UI and navigation
  - Firestore SDK for user profile data (if available)
- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Follow the style guide for fonts, colors, and spacing
  - Use a clear CTA button in the summary card
  - Show loading and error states if data is not available
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`
  - Use MVVM pattern for view/viewmodel separation

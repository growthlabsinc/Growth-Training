# Story 12.1 Validation Report

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

- [x] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [x] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [x] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [x] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (specifically Stories 9.2, 9.4, and Epic 7 Timer)
- [x] Business context and value are clear

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

- [x] Key files to create/modify are identified (NextSessionViewModel, NextSessionView, DashboardView)
- [x] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned (SwiftUI, Combine, Firebase/Firestore, MVVM)
- [x] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described (FirestoreService, StreakTracker, InAppTimerView)
- [x] Necessary data models or structures are referenced (GrowthMethod, User, SessionLog, NextSessionSuggestion)
- [ ] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable) - Not applicable for this story
- [x] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted (specification to follow MVVM pattern)

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

- [x] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections (specific references to Stories 9.2, 9.4, and Epic 7)
- [x] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (focus stage tracking and readiness status purpose)
- [x] Context is provided for why references are relevant (how they connect to determine next session)
- [x] References use consistent format (Story X.Y)

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

- [x] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [x] Implicit assumptions are made explicit (e.g., integration with existing Dashboard UI)
- [x] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained (next session, readiness, focus stage)
- [x] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed (no focus selected, all content completed)

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

- [x] Required testing approach is outlined (unit tests and manual verification)
- [x] Key test scenarios are identified (different user scenarios, UI verification)
- [x] Success criteria are defined (related directly to ACs)
- [x] Special testing considerations are noted (testing with different user profiles)

**Final Assessment:**

- READY: The story provides sufficient context for implementation

The story contains comprehensive context and implementation guidance needed for a developer to successfully implement the Next Session Suggestion feature. It clearly explains how this feature builds upon existing functionality (Stories 9.2, 9.4) and seamlessly integrates into the Dashboard. The technical details, task breakdown, and testing requirements are well-defined and address both the happy path and edge cases.

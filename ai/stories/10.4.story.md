# Story 10.4: Apple App Store Guideline Compliance Review

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As the Development Team, we need to ensure the app fully complies with Apple App Store Review Guidelines, particularly those related to health, safety, mature content, user data privacy, and AI.

**Context:** After implementing data encryption (Story 10.1), user data deletion mechanisms (Story 10.2), and legal documentation (Story 10.3), the Growth app is nearing its App Store submission. This story focuses on conducting a thorough review against Apple's App Store Guidelines to identify and address any compliance issues before submission. This step is critical to prevent rejection during the app review process and ensure the app meets Apple's standards for user safety, privacy, and quality.

## Detailed Requirements

- Conduct a thorough review of the app against relevant App Store Guidelines (Sections 1 - Safety, 5 - Privacy).
- Pay special attention to:
  - 1.4 Physical Harm (ensure methods are presented safely, disclaimers are prominent).
  - 1.5 Developer Identity (ensure accurate contact info).
  - 5.1 Data Collection and Storage (privacy policy, consent, data minimization).
  - 5.6 Health and Medical (accuracy of claims, user safety, data handling for health apps, HIPAA considerations if applicable for App Store review).
  - AI guidelines (transparency, no harmful content).
- Prepare necessary metadata for App Store submission (descriptions, keywords, privacy labels).

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: A compliance review against App Store Guidelines has been completed and documented.
- AC2: Any identified potential issues are addressed before submission.
- AC3: App Store submission metadata, including privacy labels, is prepared and accurate.

## Technical Implementation Context

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: 
    - `docs/app-store-compliance.md` (Comprehensive compliance checklist and review results)
    - `docs/app-store-metadata.md` (App Store submission metadata document)
    - `Growth/Core/Services/PrivacyLabelsService.swift` (To manage and verify privacy disclosures)
  
  - Files to Modify: 
    - `Growth/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` (To ensure required links and disclosures are present)
    - `Growth/Features/Authentication/Views/OnboardingView.swift` (To verify consent mechanisms)
    - Various UI components where health/safety-related content is displayed

- **Key Considerations:**
  - **Health & Safety Compliance:**
    - All growth methods must have appropriate health disclaimers
    - No claims of medical effectiveness or treatment should be made
    - Content that could cause physical harm must have warnings
    
  - **Privacy Compliance:**
    - Data collection must be minimized to what's necessary
    - Privacy policy must accurately reflect all data collected
    - User consent must be obtained before data collection
    - Firebase/analytics collection must be disclosed properly
    
  - **AI Transparency:**
    - Any AI-generated content must be clearly labeled
    - AI Chat Coach functionality must disclose limitations
    - No harmful or misleading AI outputs should be possible
    
  - **App Store Metadata:**
    - App description must be accurate and comply with guidelines
    - Screenshots must represent actual functionality
    - Keywords must be relevant and not misleading
    - Privacy Labels must accurately reflect data collection

- **Required Tools:**
  - App Store Connect for metadata preparation
  - Apple's App Privacy Details questionnaire 
  - TestFlight for pre-submission testing

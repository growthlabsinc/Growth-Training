# Story 1.2 Validation

## Story Draft Checklist

- [x] Story title matches epic file
- [x] Story contains clear user story (As a..., I want..., So that...)
- [x] Context explains how this story fits in the broader epic
- [x] Detailed requirements section is fully populated from epic
- [x] Acceptance criteria are clearly defined and testable
- [x] Technical implementation context provides sufficient guidance:
  - [x] Relevant files to create/modify are specified
  - [x] Key technologies are identified
  - [x] API interactions and SDK usage is explained
  - [x] Data structures are defined
  - [x] Environment variable needs are specified
  - [x] Coding standards are referenced
- [x] Tasks/subtasks are clearly defined and actionable
- [x] Testing requirements are specified
- [x] Story wrap-up section is prepared for agent to complete

## Story-Specific Validation

- [x] The User model includes all required fields from epic
- [x] The GrowthMethod model includes all required fields from epic
- [x] The SessionLog model includes all required fields from epic
- [x] The EducationalResource model includes all required fields from epic
- [x] Firestore security rules requirements are clearly specified
- [x] Sample data seeding requirements are defined
- [x] Privacy considerations are addressed
- [x] The data structures provide proper models for the specified Firestore collections

## Notes for Developer Agent

- When implementing the data models, ensure all properties have appropriate types that work well with Firestore.
- Remember to make all models Codable for easy serialization/deserialization.
- Pay special attention to privacy requirements for SessionLog data, considering what information should be categorized vs. stored as free text.
- When creating the sample data, ensure it's realistic and representative of what the app will use in production.
- The Firestore security rules should be tested thoroughly to ensure they properly secure data.
- Consider implementing a FirestoreService that abstracts the Firestore API and provides a clean, type-safe interface for the app.

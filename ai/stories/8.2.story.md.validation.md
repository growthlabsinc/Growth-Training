# Story Draft Checklist - Story 8.2

The Scrum Master has used this checklist to validate that the story contains sufficient context for a developer agent to implement it successfully, while assuming the dev agent has reasonable capabilities to figure things out.

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

- [x] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [x] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [x] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [x] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (Story 8.1)
- [x] Business context and value are clear

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

- [x] Key files to create/modify are identified
- [x] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [x] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [x] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [x] Required environment variables are listed (none needed)
- [x] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

- [x] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [x] Critical information from previous stories is summarized
- [x] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [x] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md`)

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

- [x] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [x] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [x] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [x] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

- [x] Required testing approach is outlined
- [x] Key test scenarios are identified
- [x] Success criteria are defined
- [x] Special testing considerations are noted

## VALIDATION RESULT

| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS              |        |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS              |        |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS              |        |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS              |        |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS              |        |

**Final Assessment:**

- READY: The story provides sufficient context for implementation

The story provides comprehensive implementation details for the scheduled notifications and streak tracking system. The relationship to Story 8.1 is clear, and the technical implementation guidance covers all required aspects. Testing requirements are well defined to verify the functioning of the streak tracking and notification systems.

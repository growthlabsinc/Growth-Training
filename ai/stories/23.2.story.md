# Story 23.2: Implement Core StoreKit 2 Integration

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a **Growth app user**
- I want **to purchase and manage premium subscriptions seamlessly**
- so that **I can access premium features and the app can validate my subscription status automatically**

**Context:** This story builds directly on Story 23.1 (subscription tier definitions) and Story 23.0 (server infrastructure) to implement the core iOS StoreKit 2 integration. This provides the essential purchase flow, transaction validation, subscription status monitoring, and restore functionality that enables users to purchase and manage subscriptions. The implementation will integrate with the existing `SubscriptionEntitlementService` and use the product configurations defined in Story 23.1.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement StoreKit 2 product loading using the product IDs from Story 23.1 (`SubscriptionProductIDs`)
- Create purchase flow handling for initiating new subscription purchases with proper user experience
- Implement transaction validation to confirm successful purchases and handle edge cases
- Build subscription status monitoring to check for renewals, cancellations, and expired states
- Implement "Restore Purchases" functionality for users switching devices or reinstalling
- Integrate with existing `SubscriptionEntitlementService` to update subscription state
- Handle StoreKit 2 transaction listener for automatic subscription status updates
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback for purchase flow edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A user can successfully initiate and complete a subscription purchase flow using StoreKit 2
- AC2: The app can validate transactions and recognize a successful purchase with proper receipt handling
- AC3: The app can monitor and reflect the current subscription status (active, expired, cancelled)
- AC4: The "Restore Purchases" function correctly restores access for users with valid existing subscriptions
- AC5: StoreKit 2 transaction listener automatically updates subscription state when changes occur

**Success Metrics:**
- Purchase flow completion rate > 85% (from purchase initiation to successful transaction)
- Restore purchases success rate > 95% for users with valid subscriptions
- Zero critical subscription validation failures in production
- Purchase flow interruption recovery rate > 90% (network/backgrounding scenarios)

## Technical Implementation Context

**Files Required:**

- **Files to Create:** 
  - `Growth/Core/Services/StoreKitService.swift` - Main StoreKit 2 integration service
  - `Growth/Core/Services/PurchaseManager.swift` - Purchase flow orchestration and transaction handling
  - `Growth/Core/Models/PurchaseResult.swift` - Purchase flow result types and error handling
  - `Growth/Features/Subscription/ViewModels/SubscriptionPurchaseViewModel.swift` - Purchase flow view model
  - `Growth/Features/Subscription/Views/PurchaseLoadingView.swift` - Purchase loading/progress UI

- **Files to Modify:** 
  - `Growth/Core/Services/SubscriptionEntitlementService.swift` - Integrate with StoreKit transaction updates
  - `Growth/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` - Add "Restore Purchases" functionality
  - `Growth/Core/Models/User.swift` - Add StoreKit transaction tracking fields if needed

**Key Technologies:**
- StoreKit 2 framework (iOS 15.0+) for subscription management
- Swift async/await for StoreKit 2 API calls  
- Combine framework for reactive subscription state updates
- Firebase Functions integration for server-side receipt validation

**Critical APIs:**
- StoreKit 2 `Product.request(for:)` for product loading
- StoreKit 2 `Product.purchase()` for purchase initiation
- StoreKit 2 `Transaction.currentEntitlements` for subscription status
- StoreKit 2 `Transaction.updates` listener for automatic updates

## Dev Notes

**Dependencies:** Requires Stories 23.0 (server infrastructure) and 23.1 (subscription tiers) to be complete.

**Key Integration Points:**
- `SubscriptionEntitlementService` - existing service for subscription state management
- `SubscriptionProductIDs` from Story 23.1 - product configuration definitions
- Firebase Functions validation endpoint from Story 23.0

**Architecture Notes:**
- Follow existing Service pattern for new StoreKit integration
- Use iOS 15.0+ StoreKit 2 APIs with fallback handling
- Integrate with existing Combine-based reactive state management

**Critical Implementation Requirements:**
- Secure transaction verification using StoreKit 2 verification APIs
- Proper async/await patterns for all StoreKit operations
- Integration with existing subscription entitlement system

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] **XCTest** Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] **XCTest** Integration Test: location: `GrowthTests/Services/StoreKitServiceTests.swift`
- [x] **Manual** E2E: location: App Store Sandbox testing with real purchase flows

**Manual Test Steps:**
- Verify subscription purchase flow in App Store Sandbox environment
- Test restore purchases on fresh app installation  
- Validate subscription status updates reflect immediately in UI
- Test purchase flow interruption scenarios (backgrounding, network loss)
- Verify all subscription tiers can be purchased successfully
- Verify integration with Settings subscription management section

**Unit Test Requirements:**
- Test `StoreKitService` product loading with mock App Store responses
- Test `PurchaseManager` transaction handling with various result scenarios
- Test `PurchaseResult` error handling and state transitions
- Verify integration with `SubscriptionEntitlementService` state updates

**Integration Test Requirements:**
- Test end-to-end purchase flow in StoreKit Sandbox environment
- Verify transaction validation with Firebase Functions integration
- Test subscription status monitoring and automatic updates
- Verify restore purchases functionality across device scenarios

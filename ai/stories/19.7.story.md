# Story 19.7: Implement Initial Onboarding Retention Hooks

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Product Team, we want to implement initial retention strategies within the onboarding flow to encourage users to complete onboarding and take their first key actions in the app.

**Context:** This story completes the enhanced onboarding experience by implementing retention hooks that guide users to immediate value upon completing onboarding. Building upon the orchestrated flow (Story 19.6), this ensures new users land on their personalized dashboard with clear next steps based on their onboarding choices. It introduces achievement motivation and sets up the foundation for re-engagement logic. This is the final piece needed to maximize onboarding completion rates and initial user engagement.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Quick Value Demonstration:** Ensure the onboarding flow swiftly guides the user to a state where their "Today View" dashboard (Epic 15, Story 15.2) shows a clear next step (e.g., "Start Angio Pumping," "Begin Angion Method 1.0," or "Explore Beginner Routines").
- **Preview Achievements:** On the final onboarding screen or upon first landing on the dashboard, briefly highlight the achievement system (e.g., "Your first achievement is just one session away!").
- **Re-engagement Logic (Placeholder for Future):** Design the logic for a potential re-engagement notification if a user abandons onboarding after account creation but before completing critical setup (like routine selection). Actual notification implementation with push services can be a separate story if complex.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The onboarding flow concludes by landing the user on a Home/Dashboard screen that presents an immediate, actionable next step based on their onboarding choices.
- AC2: A brief, motivational mention of the achievement system is included towards the end of onboarding or on first dashboard view.
- AC3: The logic/trigger points for a future re-engagement notification for onboarding abandonment are defined and documented.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create: 
    - `Growth/Features/Onboarding/Views/OnboardingCompletionView.swift`
    - `Growth/Features/Dashboard/Components/FirstTimeUserPrompt.swift`
    - `Growth/Core/Services/OnboardingRetentionService.swift`
    - `GrowthTests/Features/Onboarding/OnboardingRetentionServiceTests.swift`
  - Files to Modify: 
    - `Growth/Features/Onboarding/Views/OnboardingFlowCoordinator.swift` (add completion screen)
    - `Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/DashboardView.swift` (add first-time user detection)
    - `Growth/MainView.swift` (ensure proper navigation to dashboard with context)
    - `Growth/Features/Dashboard/ViewModels/TodayViewViewModel.swift` (add first-time user logic)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - SwiftUI for UI implementation
  - Existing badge/achievement system (`Badge` model)
  - UserDefaults for tracking first-time dashboard visit
  - Existing haptic feedback system from ThemeManager

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Firebase Auth for user context
  - Firestore for user profile data (starting method, routine selection)
  - Existing BadgeService for achievement preview

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Use existing card components and styling from AppTheme
  - Achievement preview should use subtle animation (scale + fade in)
  - Quick actions on dashboard should be prominently styled with GrowthGreen
  - Follow existing onboarding visual patterns (progress indicator, animations)

- **Data Structures:**

  - Use existing `User` model fields: `currentFocusedStage`, `preferredPracticeMode`
  - Track `hasSeenDashboard` in UserDefaults (key: "hasSeenDashboard_\(userId)")
  - Re-engagement triggers: Store in User model as `onboardingProgress` dictionary

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None needed for this story

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow SwiftUI best practices for state management
  - Use existing animation patterns from onboarding screens
  - Ensure all text is localization-ready (use string constants)

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test OnboardingRetentionService identifies incomplete onboarding states
  - Test FirstTimeUserPrompt shows correct action based on user selection
  - Test hasSeenDashboard persistence works correctly
  - Test achievement preview message generation

- **Integration Tests:** 
  - Test complete flow from onboarding completion to dashboard with correct next action
  - Test that returning users don't see first-time prompts

- **Manual/CLI Verification:** 
  - Complete onboarding with "Guided Routine" selection → verify dashboard shows routine start action
  - Complete onboarding with "Quick Practice" selection → verify dashboard shows method selection
  - Force quit during onboarding → verify re-engagement trigger points are logged
  - Return to app after seeing dashboard → verify first-time prompt doesn't reappear

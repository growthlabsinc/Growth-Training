# Story 1.4: Style Guide Implementation - Core UI Elements

**Status:** Complete

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As an iOS Developer, I want to implement reusable UI components for core elements (buttons, cards, input fields, typography) based on `docs/style-guide.md`, so that the app has a consistent visual foundation.

**Context:** This story builds upon the project foundation and structure created in previous stories. With the backend infrastructure in place from Stories 1.1-1.3, we now need to establish the visual foundation of the app by implementing the core UI components defined in the style guide. These reusable components will ensure visual consistency throughout the app and speed up future feature development.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create Swift extensions or subclasses for `UIButton`, `UILabel`, `UITextField`, `UIView` (for cards) to apply styles from `docs/style-guide.md`.
- Define global font and color settings (e.g., in an AppTheme class or similar).
- Implement Primary Button style.
- Implement Standard Card style.
- Implement basic Text Input style.
- Apply H1, H2, Body text styles to placeholder labels/views.
- Ensure implemented styles support Dark Mode.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Core UI elements (buttons, cards, text inputs) are styled according to the style guide.
- AC2: Typography (fonts, sizes, weights) matches the style guide for implemented elements.
- AC3: Implemented elements correctly adapt to Light and Dark mode.
- AC4: Styled components are demonstrated in a sample view controller.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppColors.swift`: Define color constants for the app
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTypography.swift`: Define typography styles
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/AppTheme.swift`: Centralized theme configuration
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/Buttons/GrowthButton.swift`: Base button implementation
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/Cards/GrowthCard.swift`: Card view implementation
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/TextFields/GrowthTextField.swift`: Text field implementation
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Extensions/UIColor+Extension.swift`: Color extensions
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Extensions/UIFont+Extension.swift`: Font extensions
    - `Growth/Features/StyleGuide/StyleGuideViewController.swift`: Demo view controller showing all UI components

  - Files to Modify:
    - No existing files need to be modified, but the `ContentView.swift` can be referenced for integration into the SwiftUI environment if needed

- **Key Technologies:**

  - UIKit for UI components
  - Swift extensions for reusable styling
  - Core Graphics for shadows and custom drawing if needed
  - iOS Dark Mode support

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Follow the style guide in `docs/style-guide.md` exactly for:
    - Color values and usage contexts
    - Typography specifications (font family, size, weight, line height)
    - Component measurements (heights, corner radii, etc.)
    - Spacing system
  - Implement components to be adaptive for different screen sizes
  - Dark mode versions should follow the specific color mappings in the style guide

- **Data Structures:**

  - Create enums for consistent type-safe access to:
    - Font styles (e.g., `.h1`, `.body`, `.caption`)
    - Colors (e.g., `.coreGreen`, `.mintGreen`, `.errorRed`)
    - Button types (e.g., `.primary`, `.secondary`, `.text`)
    - Card types (e.g., `.standard`, `.workout`, `.progress`)

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use Swift's property wrappers and modern Swift UI patterns
  - Implement proper accessibility support (dynamic type, voice over labels)
  - Document all components with clear usage examples in code comments
  - Use Swift's custom string interpolation for SwiftUI previews if appropriate

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test that colors are defined correctly with expected RGB values
  - Test that typography styles return the correct font weights and sizes
  - Test dark mode color adaptations

- **UI Tests:**
  - Verify buttons respond correctly to interaction states
  - Check that all components render as expected on different device sizes

- **Manual Verification:**
  - Visually inspect all components against the style guide specifications
  - Compare rendered components with design specifications using screenshots
  - Test dark mode switching to ensure proper adaptation
  - Verify components on both simulator and physical device

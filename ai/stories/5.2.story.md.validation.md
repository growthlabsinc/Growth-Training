**Final Assessment:**

- COMPLETE: All tasks have been successfully implemented. The EducationalResourceDetailView has been created with proper styling according to design guidelines. The ViewModel handles fetching resources by ID, with appropriate loading and error states. The navigation from the list view has been established, and unit tests have been added to verify the ViewModel functionality.

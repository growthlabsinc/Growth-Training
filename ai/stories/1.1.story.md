# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & iOS App Shell

**Status:** Complete

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want a new iOS project created with Swift, basic folder structure, and necessary SDKs (Firebase) integrated, so that I can start building features.

**Context:** This is the first story of Epic 1, establishing the foundation for the entire Growth app. It sets up the basic iOS project structure, integrates Firebase SDKs, and creates the initial navigation shell that will be used throughout the app.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create new Xcode project for an iOS app (Swift).
- Set up Bundle ID, versioning, and target iOS version.
- Integrate Firebase SDK (Firestore, Auth, Functions, Analytics, Crashlytics).
- Configure Firebase for different environments (Dev, Staging, Prod - using different Firebase projects or configurations).
- Establish basic app delegate/scene delegate setup.
- Create a basic Tab Bar Controller shell with placeholder view controllers for main sections (Dashboard, Methods, Progress, Coach, Resources, Settings).
- Define preliminary app icon and launch screen.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: iOS project compiles and runs on a simulator and a physical device.
- AC2: Firebase SDKs are integrated and a basic connection to Firebase (e.g., fetching remote config or a test Firestore read) is successful.
- AC3: Basic tab bar navigation is functional, switching between placeholder views.
- AC4: Project is committed to a version control system (e.g., Git).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - Application folder: `GrowthApp/Application/GrowthAppApp.swift`, `GrowthApp/Application/AppDelegate.swift`, `GrowthApp/Application/AppSceneDelegate.swift`
    - Core/UI: Basic UI components directory structure
    - Core/Networking: `GrowthApp/Core/Networking/FirebaseClient.swift`
    - Features: Create placeholder directories for different features
    - Resources: Set up Assets.xcassets with required resources

  - Files to Modify:
    - Existing files that need to be integrated into the new structure

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Swift 5.10+ (Latest stable version)
  - SwiftUI for UI development
  - Firebase SDKs (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Analytics, Crashlytics)
  - iOS 16.0 as minimum target version

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Firebase SDK Integration:
    - Setup with `FirebaseApp.configure()`
    - Use `FirebaseClient` wrapper for Firebase service interactions
    - Create basic connection test to ensure Firebase is properly integrated

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Initial Tab Bar should contain 6 tabs as specified in the requirements:
    - Dashboard: Overview of user's progress and activity
    - Methods: List of growth methods
    - Progress: User's progress tracking
    - Coach: AI coaching interface
    - Resources: Educational resources
    - Settings: User settings and preferences
  - Use system SF Symbols for tab bar icons initially
  - Follow the project structure in `docs/Project Structure.ini` when organizing UI components

- **Data Structures:**

  - Initial data models will be minimal for this story, focusing on project structure
  - Simple user model may be created for Firebase auth integration test

- **Environment Variables:**

  - Configure different Firebase environments (Dev, Staging, Prod) using appropriate GoogleService-Info.plist files
  - Create a mechanism to switch between environments (can be simple in this first implementation)

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow Swift standard naming conventions
  - Use SwiftUI for all new UI components
  - Create a clean separation between UI and business logic

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test Firebase client initialization
  - Verify environment configuration switching works correctly

- **Manual Verification:**
  - Verify app builds and runs on simulator
  - Test app on a physical device if available
  - Check that each tab in the navigation bar correctly displays its associated view
  - Verify Firebase connection by checking logs for successful initialization
  - Test switching between different environments (Dev, Staging, Prod)

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `Claude 3.7 Sonnet`
- **Completion Notes:** 
  
  I've successfully implemented all the requirements for this story:
  
  1. Created the proper directory structure following the project documentation
  2. Set up Firebase integration with environment support (Dev, Staging, Prod)
  3. Implemented a FirebaseClient wrapper for managing Firebase services
  4. Created a tab bar navigation with placeholder views for all six required sections
  5. Developed core UI components (PrimaryButton, CardView, TextInputField) and theme
  6. Added unit tests for the Firebase environment configuration
  7. Created a launch screen and placeholder app icons
  8. Set up Git version control with appropriate .gitignore file
  9. Created scripts for Firebase dependency setup and verification
      - `scripts/setup-dependencies.sh`: Adds Firebase dependencies using either SPM or CocoaPods
      - `scripts/verify-firebase-setup.sh`: Verifies that Firebase is properly configured
      - Updated README.md with instructions for using these scripts
  
  The app is now ready to run and displays the tab bar interface with placeholder content for each section. Firebase is properly integrated with configuration for different environments, and the code follows a clean, modular architecture that will support future feature development.

- **Change Log:**
  - Initial Draft
  - Added implementation of core app components and structure
  - Completed implementation and marked story as ready for review
  - Added dependency management scripts and improved installation documentation
  - Fixed Firebase module import issues by correcting configuration paths and adding troubleshooting script
  - Created comprehensive Firebase integration guide (docs/firebase-integration-guide.md) to help developers resolve common issues
  - Fixed redeclaration issues in AppTheme.swift by renaming typography methods to use 'Font' suffix (e.g., largeTitleFont instead of largeTitle) to avoid conflicts with static properties
  - Resolved UI component warnings - added missing icon parameters to PrimaryButton and updated preview modifiers
  - Fixed Swift app lifecycle conflict by removing duplicate @main attribute from GrowthApp.swift, ensuring GrowthAppApp.swift is the only entry point
  - Fixed TextInputField autocapitalization by using .textInputAutocapitalization modifier instead of UIKit-specific .autocapitalization
  - Fixed AppSceneDelegate URL context handling by properly passing connectionOptions.urlContexts to scene(_:openURLContexts:)
  - Fixed unused 'self' warning in FirebaseClient.swift by removing unnecessary guard statement in closure
  - Completed implementation and committed all changes to Git
  - Status updated to Complete by user request.

## Final Status: Complete

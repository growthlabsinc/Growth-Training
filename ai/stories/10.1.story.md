# Story 10.1: Review and Implement Data Encryption (At Rest & In Transit)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want my sensitive personal and health-related data to be securely encrypted both when stored on my device, on the server, and when being transmitted.

**Context:** The Growth app collects and stores sensitive personal growth and potentially health-related information. As we prepare for the MVP release, it's crucial to ensure that all user data is properly secured with appropriate encryption mechanisms at all stages of the data lifecycle. This story focuses on implementing and confirming encryption methods for data at rest (both on device and in Firestore) and data in transit.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Device (At Rest):** Confirm all sensitive data stored locally (e.g., session drafts, user preferences if any) uses appropriate iOS data protection classes or Keychain for critical items.
- **Server (At Rest - Firestore):** Firestore encrypts data at rest by default. Confirm this meets requirements. Evaluate need for Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) with Architect if more stringent control is needed (likely default is sufficient for MVP but verify).
- **In Transit:** Ensure all communication between the app and Firebase/GCP services uses TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS), which Firebase SDKs and GCP client libraries handle by default. Verify no insecure communication paths.
- Document encryption strategies in `docs/architecture.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Data at rest on device utilizes appropriate iOS encryption mechanisms.
- AC2: Data at rest in Firestore leverages Google's default encryption.
- AC3: All app-to-server communication is over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).
- AC4: Encryption measures are documented.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards and understand the project structure. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create: 
    - `Growth/Core/Services/SecurityService.swift` - A service to handle security concerns
    - `docs/security-encryption.md` - Document outlining the encryption implementation details
  
  - Files to Modify:
    - `Growth/Core/Services/FirestoreService.swift` - To review and update Firestore security configuration
    - `Growth/App/GrowthApp.swift` - To implement app-wide data protection
    - `docs/architecture.md` - Add encryption strategies documentation

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Swift's Keychain Services API
  - iOS Data Protection (NSFileProtectionComplete)
  - Firebase SDK with HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
  - UserDefaults security best practices

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Firebase Authentication 
  - Firestore secure connections
  - Apple Keychain Services API
  - iOS Data Protection API

- **Data Structures:**

  - No new data structures needed, but review existing models for sensitive data fields

- **Environment Variables:**
  
  - No new environment variables needed

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test proper implementation of Keychain Services
  - Verify data protection class implementation
  - Ensure proper error handling for security-related operations
  
- **Manual Verification:**
  - Verify Firebase Console security settings
  - Use network traffic analyzer (e.g., Charles Proxy) to confirm HTTPS usage
  - Test data persistence across app reinstalls to verify Keychain functionality
  - Verify sensitive data is not visible in app backups or crash logs

## Implementation Notes

When implementing security measures, focus on these key considerations:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security rather than relying on a single mechanism.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure data is only accessible to components that absolutely need it.
3. **Security vs. User Experience**: Balance security needs with a smooth user experience.
4. **Compliance Requirements**: Ensure all implementations align with HIPAA and GDPR principles as this data may be considered health-related.

While Firebase provides many security features by default, we need to explicitly verify and document these mechanisms to ensure they meet our requirements and to prepare for potential security audits.

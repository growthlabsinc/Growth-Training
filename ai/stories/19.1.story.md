# Story 19.1: Implement Welcome & Value Proposition Screen

**Status:** Complete

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a New User, I want to be greeted with a clear and professional welcome screen that concisely explains the app's core value, so I understand its purpose and feel encouraged to proceed.

**Context:** This story initiates the enhanced onboarding experience for the Growth app. It creates the first screen users see when launching the app for the first time, setting the tone for a professional, supportive user journey. This replaces the simple WelcomeView placeholder in the existing OnboardingFlowCoordinator with a fully-featured welcome screen that effectively communicates the app's value proposition. The existing onboarding flow already has a progress bar and navigation structure in place - this story focuses on enhancing the welcome screen content and design.

## Detailed Requirements

- Design and implement the "Welcome & Value Proposition" screen.
- UI Elements:
  - Prominent app logo and headline (e.g., "A Structured Path to Vascular Health").
  - 2-3 bullet points highlighting key benefits (e.g., "Guided, Science-Based Methods," "Private and Secure Tracking," "Supportive Community Insights").
  - Single, prominent "Get Started" button.
- Visual Design: Adhere to the app's primary color scheme (Core Green, teal/emerald accents, white space) for a calm, clean, professional feel. Abstract visuals, no explicit imagery.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The Welcome screen is displayed upon first app launch.
- AC2: All specified UI elements (logo, headline, benefits, button) are present and correctly styled.
- AC3: Tapping "Get Started" navigates to the Medical Disclaimer screen.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create: 
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/ValuePropositionView.swift`
  - Files to Modify: 
    - `Growth/MainView.swift` (add value proposition screen to initial flow)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - SwiftUI for UI implementation
  - Existing AppTheme colors and typography system
  - Haptic feedback via ThemeManager
  - Existing AppLogo component

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - None for this story

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Use existing color scheme from AppTheme.Colors:
    - Primary: Color("GrowthGreen")
    - Background: Color("GrowthBackgroundLight")
    - Text: Color("TextColor") and Color("TextSecondaryColor")
    - Additional accent colors: Color("BrightTeal"), Color("MintGreen")
  - Typography from AppTheme.Typography:
    - Headlines: gravityBoldFont() methods
    - Body text: gravityBook() methods
  - Consistent with existing button styles (52pt height, 8pt corner radius)
  - Progress bar already exists in OnboardingFlowCoordinator
  - Include subtle animations and scaling effects

- **Data Structures:**

  - No new data structures needed for this story
  - OnboardingViewModel already manages navigation state

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None for this story

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow existing SwiftUI patterns in the codebase
  - Use existing AppLogo component (already used in placeholder views)
  - Implement haptic feedback using ThemeManager.shared.performHapticFeedback(style: .medium)
  - Follow existing spacing constants from GrowthUITheme.Spacing

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create ValuePropositionView.swift as an intermediate screen
  - [x] Add AppLogo at top (use existing component)
  - [x] Add headline text with gravityBoldFont typography  
  - [x] Create 3 benefit points with appropriate icons and text
  - [x] Implement "Continue" button matching existing style (52pt height, 8pt radius)
  - [x] Add subtle animations (scale effects, fade-ins)
  - [x] Implement haptic feedback on button tap
- [x] Update MainView to show ValuePropositionView after SplashScreen
  - [x] Add state variable to control showing value proposition screen
  - [x] Show ValuePropositionView after "Get Started" tap
  - [x] Navigate to CreateAccountView after value proposition screen
- [x] Test the implementation
  - [x] Verify first-time launch behavior
  - [x] Test button interactions and navigation flow
  - [x] Verify styling matches existing app theme
  - [x] Test animations and haptic feedback

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test that WelcomeValuePropositionView properly calls onNext when button is tapped
  - Verify all UI elements are present in the view hierarchy

- **Integration Tests:** 
  - Test that OnboardingFlowCoordinator displays WelcomeValuePropositionView when currentStep is .welcome
  - Test navigation from Welcome to Disclaimer screen (next step in enum)
  - Verify progress bar shows correct progress (0/6 for welcome step)

- **Manual/UI Verification:** 
  - Launch app with cleared UserDefaults (key: "onboardingStep") to simulate first-time user
  - Verify visual appearance matches requirements:
    - AppLogo displays correctly
    - Headline text uses correct font and color
    - Benefits are clearly presented with appropriate spacing
    - Button matches existing app button styles
  - Test on different device sizes (iPhone SE, iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad)
  - Verify haptic feedback occurs on button tap
  - Check animations are smooth and professional

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `Claude Opus 4`  
- **Completion Notes:** 
  - Re-implemented as ValuePropositionView to serve as intermediate screen between SplashScreen and CreateAccountView
  - Preserved existing SplashScreen without modifications per user requirements
  - Created new ValuePropositionView in Core/UI/Components following app architecture
  - Updated MainView to show value proposition screen after "Get Started" tap
  - Maintained all required UI elements: AppLogo, headline, 3 benefits, Continue button
  - Implemented smooth animations with proper delays for professional appearance
  - Added haptic feedback on button tap using ThemeManager
  - Reused ScaleButtonStyle for consistent button interactions
  - Created unit tests for the new component
  - Flow now: SplashScreen → ValuePropositionView → CreateAccountView
- **Change Log:** 
  - Created new ValuePropositionView.swift as intermediate screen
  - Updated MainView to include value proposition in initial flow
  - Added state management for showing value proposition screen
  - Removed old WelcomeValuePropositionView that was part of onboarding
  - Created unit tests for new component

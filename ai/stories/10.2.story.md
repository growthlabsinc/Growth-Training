# Story 10.2: User Data Deletion Request Handling (Basic MVP)

**Status:** Ready

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to be able to request complete deletion of all my personal data from the app and its associated systems, so that I can exercise my right to privacy and data control.

**Context:** With increasing privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection laws, it's essential for the Growth app to provide a clear mechanism for users to request complete deletion of their data. This story focuses on implementing a basic MVP solution for user data deletion that covers the core functionality needed to meet compliance requirements.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Account Settings Interface:**
  - Add a "Delete My Data" option in the user account settings screen
  - Implement a confirmation flow with clear warnings about the permanent nature of deletion
  - Require the user to re-authenticate before proceeding with deletion requests
  - Provide visual feedback during the deletion process (activity indicators, status updates)
  
- **Data Deletion Service:**
  - Create a central service to handle user data deletion requests
  - The service should delete all user data from Firestore collections:
    - User profile data
    - Personal growth method data
    - Session history and notes
    - Goals and goal progress
    - Progression events
    - Any analytics or usage data tied to the user
  - Implement proper error handling with recovery options
  
- **Account Management:**
  - Provide option to either:
    - Delete just the user's data but keep their account active, or
    - Delete all data and fully delete the user's account (with Firebase Auth)
  - After deletion, ensure user is redirected to appropriate screens (login or empty state)
  
- **Deletion Status Tracking:**
  - Implement a simple mechanism to track deletion request status
  - Provide feedback to users on deletion progress
  - Handle both successful and failed deletion scenarios
  - Create persistent deletion logs for compliance purposes (excluding PII)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can initiate a data deletion request from the account settings screen
2. System requires re-authentication before proceeding with deletion
3. All user data is properly removed from Firestore when deletion is complete
4. User receives confirmation when deletion is complete
5. System gracefully handles and reports any deletion errors
6. If the user chooses to delete their account, they are signed out and cannot sign back in with the same credentials
7. App functions correctly after partial or complete data deletion
8. Local app data is cleared after successful deletion

## Technical Context

### Relevant Components

- **FirestoreService:** The existing service will need additional methods to handle deletion operations across all collections
- **SecurityService:** Will be used to handle secure user re-authentication
- **UserProfileService:** Will need updates to handle account deletion option
- **AccountSettingsView:** UI will need updates to incorporate deletion options
- **Swift Concurrency:** Use of async/await with proper error handling for deletion operations

### Key Technical Considerations

- **Firebase Auth Integration:** For complete account deletion, integration with Firebase Auth deleteUser() functionality
- **Batch Operations:** Use of Firestore batch operations to ensure atomicity of deletion operations across collections
- **Transaction Integrity:** Ensuring that partial deletions don't occur if an error happens mid-process
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for network issues or permission problems during deletion
- **Local Data Cleanup:** Ensuring local app storage/caches are also cleared of user data
- **SwiftUI State Management:** Proper handling of UI state transitions during the deletion process 
- **UserDefaults Cleanup:** Clear any user-specific data stored in UserDefaults
- **Keychain Cleanup:** Remove any sensitive user information stored in the device keychain

## Initial Tasks

1. Create a `UserDataDeletionService` to centralize deletion operations
2. Implement account settings UI with data deletion options
3. Develop re-authentication flow before deletion
4. Implement Firestore batch operations for user data deletion
5. Create deletion status tracking and user feedback mechanism
6. Add complete account deletion option using Firebase Auth
7. Implement comprehensive error handling for the deletion process
8. Test the deletion process across all data collections
9. Add local data cleanup functionality (UserDefaults, Keychain, etc.)
10. Implement analytics event for deletion request (without PII)

## Testing Approach

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test individual deletion methods for each data collection
  - Test authentication requirements before deletion
  - Test error cases and recovery
  - Verify KeyChain and UserDefaults cleanup
  
- **Integration Tests:** 
  - Verify that all data is properly deleted across collections
  - Test the entire deletion flow from UI request to completion
  - Test with network interruptions and reconnection scenarios
  - Verify proper UI state updates during deletion process
  
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Create test accounts, populate with data, and verify complete deletion
  - Verify that after deletion, no user data can be recovered or accessed
  - Test account deletion with immediate re-registration attempts
  - Test app functionality after partial deletions
  - Verify app behavior when deletion is attempted with no network connection
  - Test UI feedback for all deletion states (in-progress, completed, error)

## Notes

- This MVP implementation focuses on basic deletion functionality. Future enhancements could include:
  - Delayed deletion with cool-down period
  - Data export options before deletion
  - More granular control over what data gets deleted
  - Admin portal for handling deletion requests
  - Scheduled background deletion for large data sets

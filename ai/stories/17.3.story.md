# Story 17.3: Merge Calendar, Stats, and Detailed Progress Views

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to access detailed views of my practice calendar (showing intensity) and specific statistics from the consolidated Progress section, ensuring all my progress data tells a cohesive story.

**Context:** This story completes the unified progress visualization experience initiated in Stories 17.1 and 17.2. While the Progress Overview Dashboard provides high-level summaries, this story implements the detailed drill-down views for calendar visualization and statistics. It ensures that users can seamlessly navigate between overview and detailed views while maintaining visual and data consistency across all progress-related interfaces.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Calendar View (within Progress Tab):**
  - Implement a full calendar view accessible from the Progress Overview Dashboard.
  - This calendar should visualize practice intensity and duration for logged sessions on each day (e.g., using color-coding and size of indicators).
- **Statistics View (within Progress Tab):**
  - Implement a detailed statistics view accessible from the Progress Overview Dashboard.
  - Display weekly, monthly, and long-term trends for key metrics (e.g., total time, sessions per method, adherence over time).
- **Achievements View (within Progress Tab):**
  - Ensure the Achievements display is accessible from the Progress Overview Dashboard.
- Ensure these detailed views are consistent with the overall progress narrative and UI.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A detailed calendar view within the Progress tab displays logged session intensity and duration.
- AC2: A detailed statistics view within the Progress tab shows trends for key metrics.
- AC3: All progress views (Overview, Calendar, Stats, Achievements) are logically linked and present a cohesive story of user progress.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create: 
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Components/IntensityCalendarDecorator.swift` - Custom calendar decorator for intensity visualization
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Views/DetailedProgressCalendarView.swift` - Enhanced calendar view with intensity indicators
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Views/DetailedProgressStatsView.swift` - Comprehensive statistics view with charts
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Components/TrendChartView.swift` - Reusable chart component for trend visualization
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Components/StatsTrendCard.swift` - Individual stat card with trend indicator
  - Files to Modify: 
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Views/ProgressTabView.swift` - Update to use new detailed views
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Views/ProgressCalendarView.swift` - Enhance with intensity visualization
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/Views/ProgressStatsView.swift` - Replace placeholder with detailed implementation
    - `Growth/Features/Progress/ViewModels/ProgressViewModel.swift` - Add methods for stats calculations

- **Key Technologies:**

  - SwiftUI for view implementation
  - UICalendarView (iOS 16+) with custom decorations for intensity visualization
  - Swift Charts framework for trend visualization (if available on target iOS version)
  - Combine for reactive data flow

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Use existing `ProgressViewModel` methods: `dailyMinutes`, `timelineData`, `sessions(on:)`
  - Leverage `FirestoreService` for fetching session logs (already handled by ProgressViewModel)
  - Use `RoutineAdherenceService` for adherence calculations (from Story 17.2)

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Calendar intensity visualization:
    - Use color gradient: Light green (1-15 min), Medium green (15-30 min), Dark green (30+ min)
    - Size of indicator dot correlates with session duration
    - Rest days marked with special indicator if part of routine
  - Statistics view should show:
    - Line charts for trends over time (sessions, duration, adherence)
    - Bar charts for method distribution
    - Time range selector (week/month/quarter/year)
    - Comparison with previous period
  - Maintain consistent navigation flow between views
  - Ensure smooth transitions between overview and detailed views

- **Data Structures:**

  - Use existing `ProgressTimelineData` for timeline visualization
  - Use existing `TimeRange` enum for time period selection
  - Calendar intensity levels: `enum IntensityLevel { case none, light, medium, high }`
  - Statistics data: Leverage existing aggregated data from ProgressViewModel

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None specific to this story

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow SwiftUI best practices for view composition
  - Use ViewModifiers for consistent styling across progress views
  - Implement proper error handling for data loading states
  - Ensure accessibility support for calendar and chart visualizations

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test intensity level calculation based on session duration
  - Verify statistics calculations for different time ranges
  - Test trend calculation logic
- **Integration Tests:** 
  - Verify calendar decoration updates when new sessions are logged
  - Test data flow from ProgressViewModel to detailed views
  - Confirm navigation state management between views

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `Claude 3 Opus`
- **Completion Notes:** 
  - Implemented comprehensive calendar view with intensity visualization using UICalendarView (iOS 16+) and custom decorators
  - Created reusable chart components for statistics visualization without external dependencies
  - Used native SwiftUI drawing for charts to avoid introducing new dependencies
  - Integrated with existing ProgressViewModel and added new public methods for stats calculations
  - Maintained consistent styling with app theme throughout all new views
  - Fixed duplicate IntensityLevel enum definition by consolidating in IntensityCalendarDecorator
  - Rest day detection is stubbed (TODO) as it requires routine information not currently available in the calendar decorator context
- **Change Log:** 
  - Initial Draft
  - Implementation completed with all ACs met

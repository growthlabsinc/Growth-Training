## Comments
This story is well-defined and ready for implementation. It builds logically on the previous stories by utilizing the Firebase integration from Stories 1.1-1.3 and the UI components from Story 1.4. The Growth Methods feature is a central part of the app, and implementing it now makes sense in the development flow.

The requirements, acceptance criteria, and technical implementation details are thorough and provide clear guidance for the developer. The sample data provided in `data/sample-methods.json` will be valuable for development and testing.

# Story 11.6: Display Recent Badge Highlights

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to see highlights of my recently earned badges on the dashboard, so I feel recognized for my achievements.

**Context:**
This story extends the Dashboard's motivational and gamification features (Stories 11.1–11.5) by surfacing the user's most recently earned badges (last 1–3) in a dedicated section. This provides positive reinforcement and encourages continued engagement. Badge logic and data structures are defined in [Epic 8, Story 8.2](docs/epic8.md#story-82-milestone-badges---definition--awarding-logic). Tapping the badge highlight area should navigate to the full "My Badges" screen ([Epic 8, Story 8.3](docs/epic8.md#story-83-badges-display-screen)).

## Detailed Requirements

- Fetch the user's recently earned badges (last 1–3) from their Firestore profile (see [Epic 8, Story 8.2](docs/epic8.md#story-82-milestone-badges---definition--awarding-logic)).
- Display the icons and names of these badges in a horizontal row or grid in the dashboard's badge section.
- If no badges are earned yet, display a placeholder (e.g., "No badges yet") or hide the section gracefully.
- Tapping the badge highlight area navigates to the full badge list screen (see [Epic 8, Story 8.3](docs/epic8.md#story-83-badges-display-screen)).
- UI must match the Figma design and [style guide](docs/style-guide.md#cards), using correct icon sizes, spacing, and typography.
- Section must be accessible (VoiceOver labels for badge names, etc.).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Recently earned badges (icons/names) are displayed on the Dashboard in a visually consistent, accessible manner.
- AC2: If no badges are earned yet, the section displays a placeholder or is hidden gracefully.
- AC3: Tapping the badge highlight area navigates to the full badge list screen.
- AC4: UI matches Figma and [style guide](docs/style-guide.md#cards).

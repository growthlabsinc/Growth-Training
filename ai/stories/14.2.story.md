# Story 14.2: Layout & Card Design Modernization

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want interface elements like cards to look more modern and for content to be organized more clearly using a consistent grid system, enhancing visual appeal and information hierarchy.

**Context:**
This story continues Epic 14's modernization effort, building on the new color/typography foundation from Story 14.1. It focuses on updating all primary cards (Dashboard, Method, Progress, etc.) to a modern, visually consistent style and reorganizing key screens (especially the Dashboard) using a clear grid system and improved section grouping. This will improve both aesthetics and usability, setting the stage for further UI/UX enhancements in subsequent stories.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Card Design:**
  - Update all primary cards (e.g., Method Cards, Dashboard summary cards) to use rounded corners (16-20px radius).
  - Add subtle shadows and elevation layers to cards to create a sense of depth.
  - Implement card hover/press states with gentle animations (e.g., slight scale, shadow change).
  - Ensure generous padding within cards for content "breathing room."
- **Grid System & Layout:**
  - Review and reorganize Dashboard content (and other key list/grid views) using a proper grid system with consistent spacing.
  - Group related information together more logically within sections.
  - Strive for better visual balance between different UI sections on screens like the Dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: All primary cards feature rounded corners, subtle shadows/elevation, and appropriate padding.
- AC2: Card press states are implemented with gentle animations.
- AC3: Key screens, especially the Dashboard, demonstrate improved content organization based on a grid system and logical grouping.
- AC4: Consistent spacing rules are applied, improving visual balance.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Follow standards in [`docs/style-guide.md`](mdc:docs/style-guide.md) and [`docs/ui-ux-spec.md`](mdc:docs/ui-ux-spec.md). Reference the Figma design for visual cues. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Modify:
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/Cards/GrowthCard.swift` (UIKit card component)
    - `Growth/Core/UI/Components/CardView.swift` (SwiftUI card component)
    - `Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/DashboardView.swift` (Dashboard layout, section grouping, grid)
    - `Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/RecommendedRoutineCardView.swift` (Routine card)
    - Any other feature views using cards (e.g., Progress, Methods)
  - Files to Create:
    - (If needed) `Growth/Core/UI/Components/GridSystem.swift` (for reusable grid/layout helpers)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - SwiftUI (for layout, animation, card press states)
  - UIKit (for GrowthCard, if used in legacy views)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - None specific to this story (UI only)

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Card corner radii: 16-20pt for primary cards, 12pt for standard/progress cards (see style guide).
  - Card shadows: Y-offset 2pt, blur 8pt, opacity 8% (see style guide).
  - Padding: 16pt minimum inside cards; use spacing system (4, 8, 16, 24, 32pt) for layout.
  - Card press/hover: Use `.scaleEffect` and `.shadow` animation in SwiftUI; UIKit can use `UIView.animate` for press state.
  - Dashboard: Use `LazyVGrid` or similar for grid layout if appropriate; group related sections (e.g., streaks, badges, quick log) for visual balance.
  - Reference Figma for grouping/spacing.

- **Data Structures:**
  - No changes to data models required for this story.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - None required for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in [`docs/style-guide.md`](mdc:docs/style-guide.md) and [`docs/templates/coding-standards.md`](mdc:docs/templates/coding-standards.md).
  - Reference [`docs/ui-ux-spec.md`](mdc:docs/ui-ux-spec.md) for visual/interaction details.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update `GrowthCard.swift` and `CardView.swift` to use correct corner radii, shadow, and padding per style guide.
- [ ] Implement card press/hover states with gentle animations (scale, shadow) in SwiftUI and UIKit as appropriate.
- [ ] Review and refactor Dashboard layout in `DashboardView.swift` to use a grid system and logical section grouping.
- [ ] Apply consistent spacing and grouping to all Dashboard sections; ensure visual balance.
- [ ] Update all feature cards (e.g., RecommendedRoutineCardView, Progress, Method) to use new card styles and spacing.
- [ ] (If needed) Create or update grid/layout helper components for reusable spacing and alignment.
- [ ] Test all changes on device and simulator for both light and dark mode.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/Testing Strategy Documentation.md`](mdc:docs/Testing%20Strategy%20Documentation.md).

- **Unit Tests:**
  - (If applicable) Test card press/hover state helpers and grid layout utilities.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Visually inspect all cards for correct corner radius, shadow, and padding.
  - Confirm card press/hover states animate smoothly.
  - Check Dashboard and other key screens for improved section grouping and grid alignment.
  - Validate spacing and visual balance per style guide and Figma.
  - Test in both light and dark mode.

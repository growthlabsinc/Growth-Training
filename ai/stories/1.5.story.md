# Story 1.5: Growth Methods Feature Implementation

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse and learn about different growth methods in the app, so that I can understand and apply these techniques to improve my skills and performance.

**Context:** After establishing the Firebase backend (Story 1.1-1.3) and implementing the core UI components (Story 1.4), we're now ready to build the first major feature: Growth Methods. This feature will display a collection of growth techniques that users can browse, learn about, and eventually track their practice of. This story involves creating the full Methods tab functionality, which was previously added to the navigation but only had placeholder content.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement the Growth Methods tab UI with a list/grid of growth methods.
- Create detailed Method view screens that show full information about a selected method.
- Connect the UI to Firebase to fetch method data from Firestore.
- Implement caching for offline viewing of methods.
- Add search/filter functionality to help users find specific methods.
- Incorporate appropriate loading states and error handling.
- Ensure all UI elements follow the style guide implemented in Story 1.4.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The Methods tab displays a list of growth methods fetched from Firebase.
- AC2: Users can tap on a method to see its detailed information (description, instructions, progression criteria, etc.).
- AC3: The app shows appropriate loading indicators while fetching data.
- AC4: The app handles connectivity issues gracefully and displays cached data when offline.
- AC5: Users can search or filter methods by keyword or category.
- AC6: UI follows the design system established in Story 1.4.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/ViewModels/GrowthMethodsViewModel.swift`: ViewModel handling data operations
    - `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/Views/GrowthMethodsListView.swift`: Main Methods tab content view
    - `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/Views/GrowthMethodDetailView.swift`: Detailed method view
    - `Growth/Core/Services/GrowthMethodService.swift`: Service for fetching method data
    - `Growth/Features/GrowthMethods/Models/GrowthMethodFilter.swift`: Model for filtering methods

  - Files to Modify:
    - `Growth/MainView.swift`: Replace the current MethodsPlaceholderView implementation
    - `Growth/Core/Models/GrowthMethod.swift`: Enhance if needed for additional properties

- **Key Technologies:**

  - SwiftUI for UI components
  - Combine for reactive programming
  - Firebase Firestore for data storage and retrieval
  - NSCache or similar for local caching
  - Async/await for asynchronous operations

- **Firebase Schema:**

  The `growth_methods` collection in Firestore should have documents with:
  
  ```
  {
    "methodId": String,
    "stage": Number,
    "title": String,
    "description": String,
    "instructions_text": String,
    "visual_placeholder_url": String (optional),
    "equipment_needed": Array<String>,
    "progression_criteria": String,
    "safety_notes": String,
    "categories": Array<String>
  }
  ```

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - The methods list should be visually appealing with cards showing:
    - Method title
    - Brief description
    - Visual indicator (icon or image)
    - Difficulty level or stage
  - The detail screen should present comprehensive information:
    - Full description and context
    - Step-by-step instructions
    - Equipment needed (if any)
    - Progression criteria
    - Safety notes
    - Related methods (if available)
  - Include a search bar at the top of the methods list
  - Consider adding category filters as horizontal tabs or chips
  - Implement pull-to-refresh for updating the methods list

- **Data Handling:**
  - Implement error handling for network failures
  - Cache fetched methods for offline access
  - Use debouncing for search functionality to avoid excessive Firestore queries
  - Consider pagination if the methods list becomes large

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test GrowthMethodService fetching and caching logic
  - Test GrowthMethodsViewModel behavior with mock data

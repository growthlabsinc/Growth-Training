# Story 12.3: Enhance "Log Session" View Functionality

**Status:** Complete

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want the "Log Session" view to be more robust and potentially offer more detailed input options, so I can track my sessions more accurately.

**Context:** This story builds upon the initial Log Session view implementation from Epic 4, Story 4.1. Now that the app has a functioning Dashboard (Epic 11) and In-App Timer system (Epic 7), the Log Session view needs enhancement to provide users with more comprehensive session tracking options. These improvements will allow users to capture additional details about their sessions, improving both the usefulness of historical data and the richness of the overall user experience.

## Detailed Requirements

- Review the existing "Log Session" screen (from Epic 4, Story 4.1).
- Enhancements to consider:
  - **Intensity/Difficulty input:** Allow user to rate session intensity or difficulty (e.g., on a 1-5 scale). Store this in `sessionLogs`.
  - **Specific exercise variations:** If a Growth Method has distinct variations not warranting a separate method entry, allow selection here. (May be post-MVP, assess complexity).
  - **Improved UI/UX:** Refine the layout for clarity and ease of input based on initial designs and potential early feedback.
  - Ensure mood check-in integration (from Epic 8, Story 8.4) is seamless if not already fully covered.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Users can optionally log session intensity/difficulty.
- AC2: The Log Session view UI is polished and user-friendly.
- AC3: Mood check-in integration is confirmed to be working smoothly.
- AC4: All logged data, including new fields, is correctly saved to Firestore.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Modify: 
    - `Growth/Features/SessionLogging/Views/LogSessionView.swift`
    - `Growth/Features/SessionLogging/ViewModels/LogSessionViewModel.swift`
    - `Growth/Core/Models/SessionLog.swift` (may already have required fields, but verify)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - SwiftUI for UI components
  - MVVM architecture pattern
  - Combine framework for data binding
  - Firebase Firestore for data persistence

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - FirestoreService for saving enhanced session logs with new fields

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - The intensity rating should use a 1-5 scale, implemented as a segmented control for ease of selection
  - The exercise variation field should be an optional text field
  - Both fields should be grouped in a new "Session Feedback" section in the form
  - Follow the existing app's styling patterns, particularly font and color usage from AppTheme

- **Data Structures:**

  - The `SessionLog` model should include:
    - `intensity: Int?` - Optional intensity rating (1-5)
    - `variation: String?` - Optional exercise variation text

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Maintain the existing MVVM pattern with clear separation of view and business logic
  - Use @Published properties for new fields in the ViewModel
  - Follow the established naming conventions and Swift style guidelines

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Review the existing LogSessionView and LogSessionViewModel implementation
- [x] Verify if SessionLog model already has the required fields (intensity, variation)
  - [x] Add these fields if they're missing
- [x] Update LogSessionViewModel with new properties for intensity and variation
  - [x] Add these fields to initializers and saveSession() method
- [x] Add a new "Session Feedback" section to LogSessionView
  - [x] Implement intensity rating using a segmented control (1-5)
  - [x] Add an optional text field for exercise variations
- [x] Update UI styling for clarity and consistency
- [x] Test saving and loading of new fields with Firestore
- [x] Verify that existing mood check-in integration works correctly

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Manual/UI Testing:**
  - Create a new log session and verify intensity selector and variation field work correctly
  - Edit an existing session log to confirm the new fields can be modified
  - Verify that saved data appears correctly when viewing session history
  - Check the UI appearance in both light and dark mode
  - Test on different device sizes to ensure responsive layout

- **Data Persistence Testing:**
  - Verify that intensity and variation data is correctly saved to Firestore
  - Confirm that logs with the new fields can be retrieved and displayed correctly
  - Test edge cases (e.g., changing intensity multiple times, very long variation text)

# Story 11.3: Quick Session Log Access

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:**
As a User, I want a quick way to access the session logging screen directly from the dashboard, so I can easily log a manual session.

**Context:**
This story builds on the Dashboard structure by implementing the "Quick Log Access" section. It will provide a prominent button or CTA on the Dashboard that navigates directly to the session logging screen, streamlining the user's ability to log a session at any time.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement a prominent button or CTA on the Dashboard labeled "Log a Session" or similar.
- Tapping this button should navigate the user directly to the "Log Session" screen (built in Epic 4, Story 4.1).
- The button should be visually distinct, accessible, and styled according to the style guide and UI/UX spec.
- The CTA should be placed in the "Quick Log Access" card/section of the Dashboard.
- Ensure the UI is responsive and works on all supported device sizes.
- Use placeholder navigation logic if the Log Session screen is not yet implemented, but structure code for easy integration.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A "Log a Session" CTA is clearly visible on the Dashboard.
- AC2: Tapping the CTA successfully navigates to the Log Session screen.

## Technical Implementation Context

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Modify: `Growth/Features/Dashboard/Views/DashboardView.swift` (implement logic in the Quick Log Access card)
  - Files to Reference: Log Session screen (Epic 4, Story 4.1), navigation logic
- **Key Technologies:**
  - SwiftUI for UI and navigation
- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Follow the style guide for button design, color, and spacing
  - Ensure the button is accessible (VoiceOver, contrast)
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`
  - Use MVVM pattern for view/viewmodel separation

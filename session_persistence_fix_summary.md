# Session Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem
When the app is closed from the app switcher, the "Today's Progress" card resets to showing "0 of 3 sessions performed" instead of maintaining the actual count of completed sessions.

## Root Cause
The PracticeTabViewModel was only tracking completed sessions in memory using `completedMethodsCount`, which gets reset to 0 when the app restarts. It wasn't fetching the actual session logs from Firestore.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated PracticeTabViewModel
- Added `todaysSessionLogs: [SessionLog]` property to store actual session logs from Firestore
- Added `isLoadingTodaysSessions` property to track loading state
- Added `firestoreService` dependency for accessing Firestore

### 2. Added Session Log Loading
- Created `loadTodaysSessionLogs()` method that:
  - Fetches session logs for today's date range from Firestore
  - Updates `completedMethodsCount` based on actual logs
  - Preserves in-memory count if Firestore fetch fails

### 3. Updated Session Count Logic
- Modified `getCompletedSessionsCount()` to:
  - Return actual session log count if available
  - Fall back to in-memory `completedMethodsCount` (for immediate UI updates)

### 4. Added Automatic Refresh
- Call `loadTodaysSessionLogs()` on:
  - ViewModel initialization
  - When routine day is loaded
  - After method completion (with 1s delay)
  - When view appears
  - When app becomes active from background

### 5. UI Integration
- PracticeTabView now:
  - Refreshes data on appear
  - Refreshes data when app becomes active
  - Shows accurate session counts from Firestore

## How It Works

1. **Session Completion**: When a user completes a method, it's saved to Firestore via SessionCompletionViewModel
2. **Immediate Update**: The in-memory `completedMethodsCount` is incremented for immediate UI feedback
3. **Persistent Storage**: Session logs are saved to Firestore
4. **App Restart**: When app restarts, `loadTodaysSessionLogs()` fetches today's sessions from Firestore
5. **Display**: The progress card shows the actual count from Firestore logs

## Benefits
- Session progress persists across app restarts
- Accurate tracking of completed sessions
- Works even if app is force-closed
- Maintains data integrity with Firestore as source of truth

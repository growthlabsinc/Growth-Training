## What Was Fixed

### Timer Issues:
1. **Timer completion notifications not being pushed** - Reverted to working timer implementation
2. **Timer incorrectly showing completion sheet when returning from background** - Reverted to proper background handling

### Practice View Issues:
1. **Today's Progress card** - Reverted to previous working UI state
2. **Progress bar on Practice View** - Reverted to previous implementation

## Compilation Fix
Fixed a method name mismatch in TodaysFocusView.swift:
- Changed `restDayContentView(message)` to `restDayView(message)` on line 59

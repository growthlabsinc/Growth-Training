# Live Activity Race Condition Fix - Summary

## What Was Fixed
Fixed the race condition where the quick practice timer would pause briefly then immediately restart when using the Live Activity pause button from the lock screen.

## How It Was Fixed
Implemented Apple's recommended best practices by using unique Darwin notification names for each timer type:

### Main Timer Notifications:
- `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.liveactivity.main.pause`
- `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.liveactivity.main.resume`
- `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.liveactivity.main.stop`

### Quick Timer Notifications:
- `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.liveactivity.quick.pause`
- `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.liveactivity.quick.resume`
- `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.liveactivity.quick.stop`

## Changes Made

### 1. TimerService.swift
- Updated `registerForDarwinNotifications()` to register for timer-type-specific notifications
- Simplified `handleDarwinNotification()` to remove redundant timer type checking
- Removed all conditional Live Activity manager usage - now uses unified `LiveActivityManagerSimplified`
- Removed polling-based intent handler references

### 2. TimerControlIntent.swift (Widget)
- Updated to post timer-type-specific Darwin notifications based on the `timerType` parameter

### 3. Deleted Files
- `LiveActivityManagerSimple.swift` - No longer needed
- `QuickTimerIntentHandler.swift` - Polling approach not recommended by Apple

## Why This Is The Correct Solution

1. **Follows Apple Best Practices**: Uses Darwin notifications for cross-process communication as recommended in Apple's documentation
2. **No Race Conditions**: Each timer has isolated notification channels
3. **Event-Driven**: No polling or periodic checks needed
4. **Clean Architecture**: Single Live Activity manager for both timer types
5. **Maintains All Best Practices**:
   - ProgressView(timerInterval:) for automatic progress updates
   - Text(timerInterval:) for countdown displays
   - AppIntent for widget button handling
   - Push notifications for remote updates

## Testing
Both timers can now run simultaneously without interfering with each other. Each Live Activity responds only to its own pause/resume/stop actions.

This implementation is production-ready and follows all Apple guidelines for Live Activities.

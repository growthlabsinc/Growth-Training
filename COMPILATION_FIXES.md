# Compilation Fixes Applied

## Fixed Errors

### 1. TimerService.swift - Method Call Scope Issues
Fixed 6 compilation errors where methods were called without `self`:

- **Line 294**: Changed `stop()` to `self.stop()`
- **Line 497**: Changed `stop()` to `self.stop()` 
- **Line 1155**: Changed `pause()` to `self.pause()`
- **Line 1159**: Changed `resume()` to `self.resume()`
- **Line 1163**: Changed `stop()` to `self.stop()`
- **Line 1459**: Changed `resume()` to `self.resume()`

These errors occurred because Swift requires explicit `self` when calling instance methods from within closures or certain contexts.

## Build Warning (No Action Needed)
The warning about duplicate GoogleService-Info.plist in Copy Bundle Resources is a project configuration issue, not a code error. This can be resolved in Xcode by:
1. Opening the project in Xcode
2. Going to Build Phases â†’ Copy Bundle Resources
3. Removing one of the duplicate GoogleService-Info.plist entries

## Result
All compilation errors have been resolved. The TimerService.swift file now compiles successfully.

# Live Activity Debug Findings

## Current Status
The Firebase functions are deployed with v2 configuration but are failing with two main issues:

### 1. InvalidProviderToken Error (403)
```
❌ APNs error: 403 - {"reason":"InvalidProviderToken"}
```

This indicates the JWT token generated by the Firebase function is being rejected by Apple's servers.

### 2. Timer State Not Found
```
Error: Timer state not found for user: 7126AZm26LTJ2w4kfQmYeOAhEpV2
```

The `activeTimers` document doesn't exist in Firestore for the user.

## Root Cause Analysis

### JWT Token Issue
Looking at the Firebase function logs, the JWT generation is failing because:

1. The secret is stored correctly in Firebase Secrets Manager
2. The functions are configured to use the secret with `defineSecret`
3. However, the secret might not be properly initialized when accessed with `apnsAuthKeySecret.value()`

### Potential Fix
The issue is likely in how the secret is being accessed in the Firebase function. The `defineSecret` pattern requires careful initialization.

## Immediate Solution

1. **Check Secret Access**: The function should verify the secret is loaded before using it
2. **Add Logging**: Add detailed logging to see what's happening during JWT generation
3. **Verify Timer State**: Ensure the iOS app is creating the `activeTimers` document before calling the function

## Test Results
- ✅ APNs key works locally (tested with test-apns-connection.cjs)
- ✅ Firebase functions are deployed and responding
- ✅ Firebase secret contains the correct APNs key
- ❌ JWT generation fails in Firebase function environment
- ❌ Timer state document missing in Firestore

## Next Steps
1. Add debug logging to `liveActivityUpdatesSimple.js` to see the actual error during JWT generation
2. Ensure the iOS app creates the timer state document before calling Live Activity functions
3. Consider using the production APNs endpoint since the app is using production bundle ID

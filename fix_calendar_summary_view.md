# Fix for CalendarSummaryView Build Error

## Issue
The build was failing with:
```
Error opening input file '/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Progress/Components/CalendarSummaryView.swift' (No such file or directory)
```

## Solution Applied
Created the missing `CalendarSummaryView.swift` file in the expected location with appropriate implementation.

## Next Steps Required
The file has been created but needs to be added to the Xcode project:

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Right-click on the `Growth/Features/Progress/Components` folder
3. Select "Add Files to Growth..."
4. Navigate to and select `CalendarSummaryView.swift`
5. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is unchecked (file already exists)
6. Make sure the "Growth" target is checked
7. Click "Add"

## Alternative: Command Line Fix
If you prefer to fix this via command line, you can manually edit the project.pbxproj file, but this is more complex and error-prone.

## File Created
`/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Growth/Growth/Features/Progress/Components/CalendarSummaryView.swift`

The file implements a calendar view component for the Progress feature that displays:
- Monthly calendar grid
- Session indicators for days with practice
- Navigation between months
- Integration with ProgressViewModel

The implementation matches the existing app architecture and styling patterns.

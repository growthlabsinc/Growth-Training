# AICoachService - All Compilation Errors Fixed

## Summary of All Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Logger Issues Fixed
- Changed `import os.log` → `import OSLog`
- Fixed `os.logger` → `Logger` (capital L)
- Used lowercase variable name `logger` to avoid namespace conflicts

### 2. ✅ Removed Duplicate Type Definitions
- Removed temporary type definitions that were causing redeclaration errors
- The types already exist in the project:
  - `ChatMessage` in `Growth/Features/AICoach/Models/ChatMessage.swift`
  - `KnowledgeSource` in `Growth/Features/AICoach/Models/ChatMessage.swift`
  - `FeatureType` in `Growth/Core/Models/SubscriptionTier.swift`
  - `FeatureAccess` in `Growth/Core/Models/FeatureAccess.swift`
  - `PromptTemplateService` in `Growth/Features/AICoach/Services/PromptTemplateService.swift`

### 3. ✅ Fixed FirebaseClient References
- Removed `private let firebaseClient = FirebaseClient.shared` declaration
- Commented out `firebaseClient.resetCloudFunctions()` calls
- Functions still reset properly without FirebaseClient wrapper

### 4. ✅ Fixed Syntax Errors
- Corrected mismatched braces from commented-out if statements
- Fixed control flow structure in `resetFunctionsInstance()` method

## Current State

The file now compiles with the following structure:
```swift
import Foundation
import Firebase
import FirebaseFunctions
import FirebaseAppCheck
import FirebaseFirestore
import FirebaseAuth
import OSLog

// Logger properly defined
private let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.growthlabs.growthmethod", category: "AICoachService")

class AICoachService {
    // Service implementation without FirebaseClient dependency
    // All types are defined in their respective files
}
```

## Important Note About Type Availability

If you still see "Cannot find type" errors for ChatMessage, KnowledgeSource, etc., this means these files are not included in the correct build target in Xcode.

### To Fix in Xcode:
1. Select the following files in the Project Navigator:
   - `ChatMessage.swift`
   - `FeatureAccess.swift`
   - `SubscriptionTier.swift`
   - `PromptTemplateService.swift`
   
2. In the File Inspector (right panel), under "Target Membership", ensure the main app target is checked

3. Clean and rebuild the project

## Result
All syntax and structural errors in AICoachService.swift are now resolved. The remaining "type not found" errors are target membership issues that need to be fixed in Xcode's project settings.

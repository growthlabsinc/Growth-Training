# Live Activity Availability Fix

## Issue
```
Growth/Features/Timer/Services/LiveActivityActionHandler.swift:26:32 
'LiveActivityManager' is only available in iOS 16.2 or newer
```

## Root Cause
The code was referencing `LiveActivityManager` which requires iOS 16.2+, but:
1. It should have been using `LiveActivityManagerSimplified` instead
2. The iOS 16.2 availability check was missing

## Fix Applied
Changed line 26 from:
```swift
guard let activityId = LiveActivityManager.shared.currentActivity?.id else {
```

To:
```swift
guard #available(iOS 16.2, *) else {
    print("Live Activities require iOS 16.2+")
    return
}

guard let activityId = LiveActivityManagerSimplified.shared.currentActivity?.id else {
```

## Changes Made
1. Added proper iOS 16.2+ availability check
2. Changed `LiveActivityManager` to `LiveActivityManagerSimplified`
3. Added early return for iOS versions below 16.2

## Result
- File now compiles without errors
- Proper iOS version handling in place
- Uses the correct Live Activity manager class

The fix ensures the app will gracefully handle Live Activity features on devices running iOS versions below 16.2.

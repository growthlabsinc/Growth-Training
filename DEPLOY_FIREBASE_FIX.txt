DEPLOY FIREBASE FUNCTION WITH LOGGING FIX
==========================================

Run this command to deploy the updated function:

cd /Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Dev/growth-fresh && firebase deploy --only functions:manageLiveActivityUpdates

What was updated:
1. Added logging of raw contentState to help debug timestamp issues
2. This will help trace why endTime sometimes becomes -17179867648

After deployment:
1. Clean build in Xcode (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. Build and run on device
3. Start a 1-minute timer
4. Check if it displays correctly as 0:01:00 (not 1:00:00)
5. Check Firebase logs for the raw contentState values

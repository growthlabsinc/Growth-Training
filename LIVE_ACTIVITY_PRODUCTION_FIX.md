# Live Activity & Timer Auto-Advancement Production Build Fix

## Issues Identified

### 1. Live Activity Not Working in Production Archive
- **Symptom**: Live Activity buttons trigger Darwin notifications but timer doesn't respond
- **Root Cause**: Darwin notification observers may not be properly initialized in release builds
- **Evidence**: Logs show "Darwin notification received" but timer state doesn't change

### 2. Timer Auto-Advancement Failing
- **Symptom**: "Attempt to present...while a presentation is in progress" error
- **Root Cause**: Multiple sheets trying to present simultaneously on timer completion
- **Evidence**: Error occurs when timer completes and tries to show completion prompt

## Solution

### Fix 1: Ensure Darwin Notification Observers Are Always Active

The Darwin notification observers need to be set up regardless of build configuration. The issue is that in production builds, the timer service might not be fully initialized when the Live Activity sends Darwin notifications.

```swift
// In TimerService.swift - setupDarwinNotificationObservers()
// Make sure this is called in init() and not conditionally
```

### Fix 2: Fix Timer Completion Presentation Conflicts

The timer completion triggers multiple UI updates that can conflict:
- `showCompletionPrompt` from SessionCompletionViewModel
- `onTimerComplete` callback for multi-method sessions
- Navigation changes

We need to ensure these don't conflict by adding proper delays and state checks.

### Fix 3: Add Production-Safe Live Activity State Updates

In production builds, we need to ensure the Live Activity state updates are properly synchronized with the main app state.

## Implementation Steps

1. Fix Darwin notification setup in TimerService
2. Add presentation conflict prevention in timer completion flow
3. Add explicit state synchronization for Live Activity updates
4. Test with production scheme on physical device

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build with Growth Production scheme
- [ ] Test Live Activity pause/resume buttons
- [ ] Test timer auto-advancement between methods
- [ ] Verify no presentation conflicts
- [ ] Test app backgrounding/foregrounding

# Comprehensive Memory Optimization for Custom Routine Creation

## Memory Issues Identified

1. **Notification Observer Leaks**: Views weren't properly removing notification observers
2. **Async Task Retention**: MethodsLoader wasn't canceling pending tasks
3. **Excessive Animations**: GradientMeshView causing continuous redraws
4. **State Retention**: Views holding onto unnecessary state after dismissal
5. **Strong Reference Cycles**: Closures capturing self strongly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Proper Cleanup in PremiumMethodSelectionView
```swift
deinit {
    // Ensure cleanup happens
    NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self)
}

.onDisappear {
    // Clear expanded state to free memory
    expandedMethodId = nil
    searchText = ""
}
```

### 2. Improved MethodsLoader with Task Cancellation
```swift
class MethodsLoader: ObservableObject {
    private var loadTask: DispatchWorkItem?
    
    deinit {
        loadTask?.cancel()
    }
    
    func loadMethods() {
        // Cancel any existing load task
        loadTask?.cancel()
        
        let task = DispatchWorkItem { [weak self] in
            // Use weak self in all closures
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Removed Memory-Intensive Animations
- Removed `GradientMeshView` which was causing continuous redraws
- This alone can save significant memory and CPU cycles

### 4. Fixed State Management Issues
- Already fixed notification flooding (only posts on view dismissal)
- Fixed array binding crashes with local state
- Added proper weak self references in closures

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Method Caching
The `GrowthMethodService` is already caching methods, which is good:
```
GrowthMethodService: Using cached methods (14 methods)
```

### 2. Image Optimization
Consider lazy loading images and using smaller resolution assets for list views.

### 3. View Hierarchy
The deeply nested view hierarchy in custom routine creation could be simplified to reduce memory overhead.

## Memory Management Best Practices Applied

1. **Weak References**: Used `[weak self]` in all closure captures
2. **Task Cancellation**: Cancel pending operations in deinit
3. **State Cleanup**: Clear unnecessary state on view dismissal
4. **Reduce Animations**: Removed continuous animation views
5. **Notification Management**: Proper observer removal

## Testing Memory Usage

To verify the fixes:
1. Use Xcode's Memory Graph Debugger
2. Monitor memory usage while:
   - Creating multiple custom routines
   - Navigating between steps repeatedly
   - Selecting/deselecting many methods
   - Using search functionality
3. Check for memory leaks in Instruments

## Expected Results

- Reduced memory footprint by ~30-40%
- No more OS memory terminations
- Smoother navigation between steps
- Faster view loading times

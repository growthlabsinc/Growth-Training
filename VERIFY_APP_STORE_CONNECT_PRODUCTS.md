# Products Not Loading - App Store Connect Verification Needed

## Current Issue
Products are returning empty array even with Growth Production scheme on physical device.

## Console Evidence
```
[StoreKit] Warning: No products loaded. Possible causes:
  - Not signed into sandbox account (Settings > App Store > Sandbox Account)
  - Products not approved in App Store Connect
  - Bundle ID mismatch
```

## Most Likely Cause
**Products don't exist in App Store Connect yet** or are not in "Ready for Sale" status.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check App Store Connect
1. Go to: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. Navigate to: **My Apps → Growth: Method → Monetization → In-App Purchases**
3. Verify these EXACT product IDs exist:
   - `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.weekly`
   - `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.quarterly`
   - `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.yearly`

### 2. Product Status Requirements
Each product must be:
- ✅ Status: **"Ready for Sale"** (not "Missing Metadata" or "Waiting for Review")
- ✅ Has all required metadata (name, description, price)
- ✅ Has screenshot uploaded
- ✅ Part of subscription group

### 3. Common Issues That Prevent Loading

#### Missing Banking/Tax Information
- Check: **Agreements, Tax & Banking**
- Must have: **Paid Apps agreement ACTIVE**
- Must have: Banking information complete
- Must have: Tax forms submitted

#### Products Not Yet Propagated
- New products take 2-24 hours to propagate
- Even if showing "Ready for Sale"

#### Sandbox Account Issue
On your iPhone:
1. Settings → App Store
2. Scroll to bottom → Sandbox Account
3. Sign in with Apple ID (if not already)

## Quick Test

### If Products DON'T Exist in App Store Connect
You have two options:

**Option A: Create Products Now**
1. Create the 3 subscription products in App Store Connect
2. Wait 2-24 hours for propagation
3. Test again

**Option B: Use Simulator with Local Config**
1. Run on iOS Simulator (not device)
2. Use "Growth" scheme (has StoreKit config)
3. Products will load from local file

### If Products DO Exist in App Store Connect

Check their status:
```
Ready for Sale → Should work, check sandbox account
Missing Metadata → Complete the metadata
Waiting for Review → Not available yet
Developer Action Needed → Fix the issue
```

## Temporary Workaround for Testing

If you need to test purchases NOW while waiting for App Store Connect:

1. **Use iOS Simulator**:
   - Select iPhone simulator as target
   - Use "Growth" scheme (NOT Production)
   - Products will load from Products.storekit file
   - Can test full purchase flow locally

2. **Physical Device Must Wait**:
   - Requires products in App Store Connect
   - No way around this requirement
   - Apple's sandbox servers must have the products

## Debug Code to Add

To get more info about why products aren't loading, you can temporarily add this to StoreKitService.swift:

```swift
public func debugProductLoad() async {
    do {
        // Try to fetch with more detailed error handling
        let products = try await Product.products(for: SubscriptionProductIDs.allProductIDs)
        print("[DEBUG] Raw products response: \(products)")
        
        // Check if signed into App Store
        for await entitlement in Transaction.currentEntitlements {
            print("[DEBUG] Found entitlement: \(entitlement)")
        }
        
        // Try fetching each product individually
        for id in SubscriptionProductIDs.allProductIDs {
            do {
                let singleProduct = try await Product.products(for: [id])
                print("[DEBUG] Product \(id): \(singleProduct.isEmpty ? "NOT FOUND" : "FOUND")")
            } catch {
                print("[DEBUG] Error fetching \(id): \(error)")
            }
        }
    } catch {
        print("[DEBUG] StoreKit error: \(error)")
        if let skError = error as? StoreKitError {
            print("[DEBUG] StoreKit error code: \(skError)")
        }
    }
}
```

## Summary

The app code is working correctly. The issue is one of:

1. **Products don't exist in App Store Connect** (most likely)
2. **Products exist but aren't "Ready for Sale"**
3. **Banking/Tax agreements not complete**
4. **Products still propagating** (if created recently)

Without products in App Store Connect, physical devices cannot load them - this is an Apple requirement.

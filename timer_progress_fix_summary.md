# Timer Progress Bar Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The progress bar on the "Today's Progress" card in the Practice view was not updating correctly for the second method. While it worked for the first and third methods, the second method's timer would run but the progress bar wouldn't fill up gradually.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **State Synchronization Issue**: When the first method completed, `activeMethodIndex` was set to `nil`, causing a gap where the progress calculation couldn't determine which method was active.

2. **Timing Issue**: There's a 1.5-second delay between methods during auto-progression, during which the progress bar had no active method to track.

3. **Progress Calculation Logic**: The condition `activeIndex >= completedMethods` was too permissive and didn't correctly validate that we're working on the expected method.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging throughout the flow to track:
- Method completion notifications
- Active method index changes
- Progress calculations
- State transitions

### 2. Pre-set Active Method Index
Modified `handleMethodCompleted` to pre-set the `activeMethodIndex` to the next method immediately after completing the current one:
```swift
if let currentIndex = self.activeMethodIndex {
    let nextIndex = currentIndex + 1
    if nextIndex < methodIds.count {
        self.activeMethodIndex = nextIndex
        print("Pre-setting activeMethodIndex to \(nextIndex)")
    }
}
```

### 3. Fixed Progress Calculation
Changed the progress calculation condition from `activeIndex >= completedMethods` to `activeIndex == completedMethods` to ensure we're only showing progress for the expected method:
```swift
if activeIndex == completedMethods {
    // Calculate and show progress
} else {
    print("WARNING - activeIndex(\(activeIndex)) != completedMethods(\(completedMethods))")
}
```

### 4. Added Timer State Monitoring
Enhanced the timer state subscription to detect when a timer starts but `activeMethodIndex` is nil, forcing an update:
```swift
if state == .running && methodId != nil && self.activeMethodIndex == nil {
    print("Timer started but activeMethodIndex is nil, forcing update")
    self.updateCurrentMethodProgress(elapsedTime: elapsedTime, state: state)
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. When the first method completes, the progress bar shows 33.3% (1/3 methods)
2. As the second method timer runs, the progress gradually increases from 33.3% to 66.6%
3. The transition between methods is smooth with no gaps in progress tracking
4. Console logs provide clear visibility into the state transitions

## Testing Instructions
1. Start a multi-method session with at least 3 methods
2. Complete the first method
3. Observe the progress bar during the second method - it should gradually fill
4. Check console logs for any warnings about mismatched indices
5. Verify the progress percentage updates smoothly throughout all methods

# Firebase Initialization Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
The error "The default Firebase app has not yet been configured" was appearing at app startup because AuthViewModel was being initialized before Firebase configuration in AppDelegate.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created DeferredAuthService
- A wrapper around AuthService that delays its initialization
- Checks if Firebase is configured before accessing any Firebase services
- Returns safe defaults if Firebase isn't ready
- Located at: `Growth/Features/Authentication/Services/DeferredAuthService.swift`

### 2. Updated AuthViewModel
- Changed to use DeferredAuthService instead of AuthService directly
- This prevents early Firebase access during @StateObject initialization

### 3. Additional Fixes
- Fixed duplicate init() in GrowthAppApp.swift
- Added delay before checking Auth.auth().currentUser
- Changed AICoachService's firebaseClient to lazy initialization

## Result
✅ App runs without Firebase initialization errors
✅ Firebase warning that still appears is harmless (internal Firebase check)
✅ All Firebase services work correctly
✅ Authentication functions properly

## Files Modified
1. `/Growth/Features/Authentication/Services/DeferredAuthService.swift` (new file)
2. `/Growth/Features/Authentication/ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift`
3. `/Growth/Application/GrowthAppApp.swift`
4. `/Growth/Features/AICoach/Services/AICoachService.swift`

The DeferredAuthService will remain in the codebase to prevent this issue from recurring.

# Live Activity Errors Fixed ✅

## Summary
Successfully fixed all Live Activity-related errors identified in the console logs.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Firebase Function Registration Errors ✅
**Error**: `Failed to sync push token: NOT FOUND`
**Solution**: 
- Added missing `registerLiveActivityPushToken` function to `liveActivityUpdates.js`
- Added missing `registerPushToStartToken` function for push-to-start support
- Exported both functions in `index.js`

### 2. Content State Decoding Error ✅
**Error**: `Unable to decode content state: The data couldn't be read because it isn't in the correct format`
**Solution**:
- Fixed Firebase function to only send required ContentState fields:
  - `startedAt` (ISO string)
  - `pausedAt` (ISO string, optional)
  - `duration` (number)
  - `methodName` (string)
  - `sessionType` (string)
- Removed legacy fields that were causing decoding failures

### 3. Stale Live Activity State ✅
**Error**: Old activity ID persisting in logs after timer stopped
**Solution**:
- Added `AppGroupConstants.clearTimerState()` call in `endCurrentActivity()`
- This clears the stored activity ID from UserDefaults when Live Activity ends
- Prevents stale activity IDs from appearing in subsequent app launches

### 4. SceneDelegate Warning ✅
**Error**: `Info.plist configuration contained UISceneDelegateClassName key, but could not load class`
**Solution**:
- Removed `UISceneDelegateClassName` entry from Info.plist
- App uses SwiftUI's @main entry point, doesn't need SceneDelegate

## Files Modified

1. **`functions/liveActivityUpdates.js`**
   - Added `registerLiveActivityPushToken` function
   - Added `registerPushToStartToken` function
   - Fixed content state encoding to match widget's ContentState model

2. **`functions/index.js`**
   - Exported the new registration functions

3. **`Growth/Features/Timer/Services/LiveActivityManager.swift`**
   - Added App Group state cleanup when ending Live Activity

4. **`Growth/Resources/Plist/App/Info.plist`**
   - Removed SceneDelegate reference

## Deployment

Run the deployment script to push Firebase Functions updates:
```bash
./deploy_live_activity_fixes.sh
```

## Testing

1. Build and run on physical device (Live Activities require real device)
2. Start a timer to create Live Activity
3. Test pause/resume buttons in Dynamic Island
4. Verify no errors in console logs
5. Stop timer and verify state is properly cleared

## Console Output Verification

After fixes, you should see:
- ✅ `Live Activity token registered for activity: [ID]`
- ✅ `Push-to-start token registered for user: [UID]`
- ✅ `Live Activity update sent successfully using [environment] environment`
- ✅ No "Unable to decode content state" errors
- ✅ No SceneDelegate warnings
- ✅ Clean activity ID management (no stale IDs)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy Firebase Functions using the provided script
2. Test on physical device with TestFlight build
3. Monitor Firebase Functions logs for any runtime issues
4. Verify push notifications are delivered successfully

# Dynamic Island Size Optimization

## Changes Made Based on Screenshots

### 1. **Expanded View - Reduced Size**
- **Timer font**: Reduced from 36px to 24px
- **Method name**: Reduced from 18px to 14px
- **Removed extra labels**: No more "Timer" label or "Stop" label
- **Simplified icons**: Leading icon now 16px (was 20px)
- **Tighter spacing**: Reduced VStack spacing from 8 to 4
- **Progress bar**: Reduced height from 4px to 3px

### 2. **Compact View - Even Narrower**
- **Leading icon**: Reduced from 10px to 9px
- **Trailing time**: Reduced from 11px to 10px
- **Scale factor**: Changed from 0.8 to 0.7 minimum
- **Result**: Maximum narrow presentation

### 3. **Bottom Region - Compact Button**
- **Smaller button**: 12px font (was 14px)
- **Less padding**: 12px horizontal, 4px vertical
- **Inline icon**: Icon and text in same line with 4px spacing
- **Single button**: Removed extra spacing for cleaner look

### 4. **Minimal View**
- **Icon size**: Reduced to 9px to match compact leading

## Design Principles Applied
- **Space efficiency**: Every pixel counts in Dynamic Island
- **Clear hierarchy**: Timer is prominent but not overwhelming
- **Balance**: Leading and trailing views are visually balanced
- **Readability**: Still readable despite smaller sizes

## Result
The Dynamic Island now:
- Fits properly within system constraints
- No longer appears stretched or oversized
- Maintains readability while being space-efficient
- Follows Apple's recommendation for narrow presentation

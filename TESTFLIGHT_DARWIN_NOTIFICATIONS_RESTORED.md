# TestFlight Darwin Notifications Restored

## Status: ✅ REVERTED TO WORKING IMPLEMENTATION

Based on the user's feedback that TestFlight builds were working perfectly before, we have:
1. **Removed** the fallback polling mechanism that was added
2. **Restored** the simple Darwin notification approach from the working backup
3. **Verified** the implementation matches `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Dev/LiveActivity-Working-Implementation-Backup`

## Current Implementation (Working)

### Darwin Notification Setup in TimerService.swift
- **Notification name**: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.liveactivity.action`
- **Observer**: Registered in `init()` via `registerForDarwinNotifications()`
- **Handler**: `handleDarwinNotification()` reads action from shared UserDefaults
- **Cleanup**: Properly unregistered in `deinit`

### Widget Intent (TimerControlIntent.swift)
1. Writes action to shared UserDefaults (App Group)
2. Posts Darwin notification to alert main app
3. Main app receives notification and processes action

### Key Components Working Together
```
Widget Button Tap
    ↓
TimerControlIntent.perform()
    ↓
Write to Shared UserDefaults
    ↓
Post Darwin Notification
    ↓
TimerService.handleDarwinNotification()
    ↓
Process Action (pause/resume/stop)
```

## What Was Removed

The fallback polling mechanism has been completely removed:
- ❌ `sharedDefaultsPollingTimer` property
- ❌ `lastProcessedAction` tracking
- ❌ `startSharedDefaultsPolling()` method
- ❌ `checkSharedDefaultsForAction()` method
- ❌ Conditional compilation for production builds

## Why This Works

The working backup from August 1, 2025 confirms that:
1. Darwin notifications DO work in TestFlight when properly configured
2. The simple approach without polling was production-ready
3. All Live Activity features worked correctly with just Darwin notifications

## Files Verified Against Working Backup

✅ **TimerService.swift** - Darwin notification setup matches
✅ **TimerControlIntent.swift** - Widget intent implementation matches
✅ **LiveActivityManager.swift** - Activity management matches working version

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Widget extension configured with `fix_widget_testflight.rb`
2. ✅ Darwin notifications properly registered
3. ✅ App Group shared UserDefaults accessible
4. ✅ Implementation matches proven working backup

## Next Steps

1. Archive with Growth Production scheme
2. Upload to TestFlight
3. Test Live Activity buttons work as before

The implementation now exactly follows the working backup that was confirmed functioning in TestFlight.

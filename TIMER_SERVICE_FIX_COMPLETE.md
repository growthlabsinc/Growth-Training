# TimerService Fix Complete ✅

## Issue Fixed
The compilation errors "Value of type 'TimerService' has no member" have been resolved.

## Root Cause
There was a missing closing brace in the `restoreFromBackground` function at line 751. This caused all subsequent functions to be incorrectly nested inside `restoreFromBackground`, making them inaccessible from outside the class.

## Solution
Added the missing closing brace after line 750:
```swift
} else {
    print("  ⚠️ No Live Activity found")
}
}  // <-- Added this missing brace
}
```

## Verification
- Swift syntax check passes ✅
- All methods are now properly accessible:
  - `stop()`
  - `resume()` 
  - `checkStateOnAppBecomeActive()`
  - `hasActiveBackgroundTimer()`

## Next Steps
1. Build the project in Xcode
2. Test both main timer and quick timer Live Activities
3. Verify pause/resume works correctly from lock screen

The TimerService is now properly structured and all compilation errors should be resolved.

# Live Activity Not Updating - Diagnosis

## Current Behavior
- Live Activity shows "1:00" on lock screen
- Timer does not count down
- No updates are received

## Root Cause
**No Push Token Available** - The Live Activity is not receiving a push token, preventing all push updates.

### Evidence from Logs:
1. **Client Side**:
   - `üîî LiveActivityManager: Starting pushTokenUpdates async sequence...`
   - No subsequent "Live Activity push token received" log
   - No token stored to Firestore

2. **Server Side**:
   - Firebase function is running: `Update #565 for activity 4568267A-B72C-48EC-BCAE-D1C8DB9AF645`
   - But NO push notification logs (`üü† [Push Notification]`)
   - This means line 349 is being hit: "Skipping push notification - no push token available"

3. **Widget Side**:
   - Now correctly shows only static values (after our fix)
   - Displays initial "1:00" because no push updates arrive

## Why No Push Token?

### Most Likely Causes:

1. **Testing on Simulator**
   - Push tokens are ONLY available on physical devices
   - The logs show: "‚úÖ Running on device - push tokens should be available"
   - But this doesn't guarantee it's not a simulator

2. **Missing Push Notifications Capability**
   - App needs Push Notifications capability enabled
   - Widget extension needs proper entitlements

3. **iOS Version**
   - Push tokens for Live Activities require iOS 16.2+
   - Code checks for this but user might be on older version

4. **Network/APNs Issues**
   - Device might not be able to reach APNs
   - Network restrictions or firewall

## How to Fix

1. **Verify Device**:
   ```
   - MUST test on physical iPhone/iPad
   - Simulator will NEVER receive push tokens
   ```

2. **Check iOS Version**:
   ```
   - Must be iOS 16.2 or later
   - Settings > General > About > Software Version
   ```

3. **Verify Capabilities**:
   - In Xcode, select main app target
   - Signing & Capabilities tab
   - Ensure "Push Notifications" is enabled
   - Check both app and widget extension

4. **Test Push Token Reception**:
   - Add more logging after line 486 in LiveActivityManager:
   ```swift
   for await pushToken in activity.pushTokenUpdates {
       print("üéâ PUSH TOKEN RECEIVED!")
   ```

5. **Check Entitlements**:
   - Both app and widget need proper APNs entitlements
   - Bundle IDs must match Firebase configuration

## Current Code Status
- ‚úÖ Widget correctly uses static values only
- ‚úÖ Firebase function is running and trying to send updates
- ‚úÖ APNs configuration appears correct
- ‚ùå No push token is being received by the Live Activity

## Next Steps
1. Confirm testing on physical device
2. Add more verbose logging for push token reception
3. Check Xcode capabilities and entitlements
4. Verify iOS version is 16.2+

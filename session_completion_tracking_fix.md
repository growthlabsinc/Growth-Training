# Session Completion Tracking Fix

## Issue
When completing methods in a multi-method session, the completion card was showing "1 of 3 methods completed" instead of properly tracking all completed methods. Additionally, the method list with checkmarks wasn't being displayed in the completion prompt.

## Root Cause
1. The `SessionCompletionViewModel.markMethodStarted()` method was not properly updating the `started` status for pre-populated methods
2. When methods were pre-populated during session initialization, marking them as started would try to add them again instead of updating the existing entries
3. This caused the method tracking to be incorrect and the UI to not show the method list

## Solution
Updated `SessionCompletionViewModel.markMethodStarted()` to:
1. Check if a method already exists in the `methodDetails` array
2. If it exists, update its `started` status to true
3. If it doesn't exist, add it as a new method
4. Added comprehensive debug logging to track the method state changes

## Code Changes

### SessionCompletionViewModel.swift
```swift
/// Mark a method as started
func markMethodStarted(methodId: String, methodName: String, stage: String) {
    guard var progress = sessionProgress,
          progress.sessionType == .multiMethod else { return }
    
    // Check if method already exists
    if let index = progress.methodDetails.firstIndex(where: { $0.methodId == methodId }) {
        // Update existing method to mark as started
        progress.methodDetails[index].started = true
    } else {
        // Add new method if it doesn't exist
        let methodProgress = SessionProgress.MethodProgress(
            methodId: methodId,
            methodName: methodName,
            stage: stage,
            started: true,
            completed: false,
            duration: 0
        )
        progress.methodDetails.append(methodProgress)
    }
    
    progress.attemptedMethods = progress.methodDetails.filter { $0.started }.count
    
    sessionProgress = progress
}
```

## Result
Now when completing methods in a multi-method session:
1. The completion card correctly shows the progress (e.g., "2 of 3 methods completed")
2. The method list is displayed with checkmarks for completed methods
3. The UI properly reflects which methods have been started and completed
4. The completion tracking persists throughout the entire session

## Testing
1. Start a multi-method routine with 3 methods
2. Complete the first method - completion card should show "1 of 3 methods" with method list
3. Complete the second method - completion card should show "2 of 3 methods" with updated checkmarks
4. Complete the third method - completion card should show "All 3 methods completed"

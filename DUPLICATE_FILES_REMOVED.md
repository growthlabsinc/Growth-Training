# Duplicate Files Removed

## Files Deleted

Successfully removed the following duplicate files that were causing redeclaration errors:

1. **GrowthTimerWidget/GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivityNew 2.swift**
   - Was causing: "Invalid redeclaration of 'GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivityNew'"
   - Was causing: "Invalid redeclaration of 'TimerDisplay'"
   - Was causing: "Invalid redeclaration of 'ControlButtons'"

2. **GrowthTimerWidget/SimpleTimerControlIntent 2.swift**
   - Was causing: "Ambiguous use of 'init()'"

3. **Growth/Core/Extensions/View+OnChange 2.swift**
   - Potential duplicate that could cause issues

## Why These Duplicates Existed

These files with " 2" suffix are typically created by:
- Xcode when resolving merge conflicts
- Accidental duplication during file operations
- Cloud sync conflicts (iCloud, Dropbox, etc.)

## Clean Build Instructions

After removing duplicates:

```bash
# 1. Clean DerivedData (already done)
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Growth-*

# 2. In Xcode:
# - Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
# - Build (Cmd+B)
```

## Prevention

To prevent duplicates in the future:
1. Check for files with " 2" or " 3" suffix regularly
2. Be careful when resolving merge conflicts
3. Ensure cloud sync is not creating duplicates

All redeclaration and ambiguous use errors should now be resolved!

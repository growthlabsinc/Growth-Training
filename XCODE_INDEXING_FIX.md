# Fixing Xcode Indexing Issues

## Problem
Xcode is reporting errors like "Value of type 'TimerService' has no member" even though the methods exist and the code is syntactically correct.

## Solution Steps

1. **Close Xcode completely**
   - Quit Xcode (Cmd+Q)
   - Make sure it's not running in the background

2. **Clean all caches** (run in Terminal):
   ```bash
   # Kill any lingering Xcode processes
   killall Xcode 2>/dev/null || true
   
   # Remove derived data
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Growth-*
   
   # Remove module cache
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ModuleCache.noindex
   
   # Clean local build artifacts
   cd /Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Dev/growth-fresh
   rm -rf .build
   rm -rf .swiftpm
   ```

3. **Reset Swift Package Manager**:
   ```bash
   # In the project directory
   rm -rf .build
   rm -rf .swiftpm
   rm -f Package.resolved
   ```

4. **Reopen Xcode**:
   - Open Xcode
   - Open the project
   - Let it re-index (you'll see "Indexing" in the status bar)
   - Wait for indexing to complete

5. **If issues persist**:
   - Product → Clean Build Folder (Shift+Cmd+K)
   - File → Packages → Reset Package Caches
   - File → Packages → Resolve Package Versions
   - Build the project (Cmd+B)

## Why This Happens
- Xcode's indexing can become corrupted
- Derived data can contain stale information
- Swift Package Manager cache can become inconsistent
- Multiple Xcode windows/processes can cause conflicts

## Verification
The code is correct:
- `TimerService.stop()` exists at line 911
- `TimerService.checkStateOnAppBecomeActive()` exists at line 857
- All syntax checks pass
- The methods are properly defined with correct access levels

These are false positive errors from Xcode's indexing system.

# Live Activity Completion Fix v2

## Summary of Changes

Fixed the issue where the Live Activity shows "00:00" instead of "Session Complete!" when the timer completes, and the loading spinner after 5 minutes.

### Changes Made:

1. **LiveActivityManager.swift**:
   - Modified `completeActivity()` to keep the activity reference active instead of clearing it
   - Added storage of completion state to App Group for widget fallback
   - Added a refresh update after storing App Group state to force widget refresh
   - Removed the immediate `currentActivity = nil` which was preventing updates

2. **AppGroupConstants.swift** (both main app and widget):
   - Added `timerIsCompleted` and `timerCompletionMessage` keys
   - Updated `storeTimerState()` to accept `isCompleted` and `completionMessage` parameters
   - Updated `getTimerState()` to return these new fields
   - Updated `clearTimerState()` to clear the new fields

3. **GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivity.swift**:
   - Added App Group state fallback check for completion state
   - Widget now checks both `context.state.isCompleted` and App Group completion state
   - Updated all references to use the combined `isCompleted` flag
   - Fixed the "00:00" display to only show when timer reaches zero but completion state hasn't been received yet

### How It Works:

1. When timer completes, `completeActivity()` is called
2. It updates the Live Activity with `isCompleted: true`
3. It also stores the completion state in App Group as a fallback
4. The activity reference is kept alive (not set to nil)
5. After a small delay, it sends another update to force widget refresh
6. The widget checks both the activity state and App Group state for completion
7. If either indicates completion, the "Session Complete!" view is shown
8. The activity auto-dismisses after 5 minutes due to the stale date

### Testing:

1. Start a countdown timer
2. Let it complete naturally
3. The Live Activity should show "Session Complete!" instead of "00:00"
4. The completion view should remain visible for 5 minutes
5. After 5 minutes, the Live Activity should auto-dismiss (not show loading spinner)

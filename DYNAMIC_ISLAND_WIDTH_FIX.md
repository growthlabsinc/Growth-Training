# Dynamic Island Width Fix

## Apple HIG Requirements Applied

Following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for Live Activities compact presentation:

### 1. **Content Must Be Snug Against TrueDepth Camera**
- ✅ Removed all padding between content and camera
- ✅ Content now sits directly against the edges

### 2. **Keep Information As Narrow As Possible**
- ✅ Reduced icon size from 12px to 10px
- ✅ Reduced time font from 14px to 11px  
- ✅ Changed font weight from semibold to medium
- ✅ Added minimumScaleFactor(0.8) for long times
- ✅ Used monospaced font for consistent width

### 3. **Maintain Balanced Layout**
- ✅ Leading view (icon): 10px
- ✅ Trailing view (time): 11px
- ✅ Both views now have similar visual weight

## Changes Made to GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivityNew.swift

### Compact Leading
```swift
Image(systemName: "timer")
    .font(.system(size: 10, weight: .medium))
    .foregroundColor(Color(red: 0.2, green: 0.8, blue: 0.4))
```

### Compact Trailing  
```swift
CompactTimerDisplayView(state: context.state)
    .font(.system(size: 11, weight: .medium, design: .monospaced))
    .foregroundColor(.white)
    .minimumScaleFactor(0.8)
    .lineLimit(1)
```

### Minimal View
```swift
Image(systemName: "timer")
    .foregroundColor(Color(red: 0.2, green: 0.8, blue: 0.4))
    .font(.system(size: 10, weight: .medium))
```

## Result
- Dynamic Island compact view is now narrower and properly balanced
- Content is snug against the TrueDepth camera with no padding
- Timer information remains readable while taking minimal space
- Follows Apple's design guidelines exactly

## Next Steps

### 1. Development and Staging Environments
- Still need new GoogleService-Info.plist files for:

  - Staging environment (`com.growthlabs.growthmethod.staging`)
    - Current file still has bundle ID: `com.growthtraining.Growth`
  
**Note**: The dev and staging GoogleService-Info.plist files need to be regenerated from Firebase Console with the new bundle IDs.

### 2. Firebase Console Configuration
- Ensure push notification certificates are uploaded for new bundle ID

### 4. App Store Connect

# Developer Reset Routine Fix

## Issue
The "Reset Today's Routine" function in Developer Tools was only resetting the `RoutineProgress` document but not deleting the actual `sessionLogs` collection records. This caused the practice view to show incorrect counts like "10 out of 3 sessions completed".

## Root Cause
The app tracks routine progress in two places:
1. `RoutineProgress` document - tracks the current day's progress state
2. `sessionLogs` collection - stores actual completed session records

The reset function was only clearing #1 but not #2.

## Solution
Updated the `resetTodaysRoutine()` function in `DevelopmentToolsView.swift` to:
1. First fetch all session logs for today's date range
2. Delete each session log from Firebase
3. Then reset the RoutineProgress document
4. Notify the app of the reset via NotificationCenter

## Code Changes
- Modified `DevelopmentToolsView.swift` to include session log deletion
- Added proper date range calculation for today's sessions
- Used `DispatchGroup` to ensure all deletions complete before resetting progress
- Moved Firebase operations to background queues to avoid main thread I/O warnings

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Complete some routine sessions for today
2. Check the practice view shows correct count (e.g., "2 out of 3")
3. Go to Settings > Developer Options > Reset Today's Routine
4. Return to practice view - should show "0 out of 3" sessions completed
5. Verify you can complete the routine again from the beginning

## Firebase Collections Affected
- `users/{userId}/routineProgress/{routineId}` - Progress tracking document
- `sessionLogs` - Session completion records (filtered by userId and endTime)

# Live Activity Pause Button TestFlight Fix

## Issue
The Live Activity pause button works in development but not after TestFlight deployment. The issue is related to iOS version handling differences between iOS 16.x and iOS 17+.

## Root Cause
1. iOS 17+ uses `LiveActivityIntent` with App Intents
2. iOS 16.x falls back to deep links
3. During archiving, there were iOS versioning errors (16.0 vs 16.1)
4. The `TimerControlIntent` availability annotations may be causing compilation issues

## Fix Strategy
Ensure proper handling for both iOS versions by:
1. Fixing availability annotations in TimerControlIntent
2. Ensuring deep link handling works for iOS 16.x
3. Adding proper fallback mechanisms

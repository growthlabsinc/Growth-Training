fix: Implement push-driven Live Activity architecture to prevent 30-second timer pause

- Remove automatic timer pause when iOS background task expires after 30 seconds
- Add server-side push updates that trigger on both timer start and resume actions  
- Update LiveActivityPushService to use userId instead of activityId for Firestore documents
- Configure APNs authentication for Live Activity push notifications
- Update Firebase Function to handle missing push tokens gracefully
- Add extensive logging throughout the push update system

The timer now continues running indefinitely via server-side push notifications,
even when the app is backgrounded or terminated. The Firebase Function sends
updates every second to keep the Live Activity timer running.

Changes made:
- TimerService.swift: Removed pause() call when background task expires
- LiveActivityPushService.swift: Fixed document ID to use userId, added resume trigger
- LiveActivityManager.swift: Added local update before push for immediate feedback
- manageLiveActivityUpdates.js: Fixed to use userId for document access, handle missing tokens
- firestore.rules: Added permissions for activeTimers and liveActivityTokens collections
- index.js: Commented out missing test-simple module reference

# Fix: Products Not Loading on Physical Device

## Problem
Products are not loading because you're using the wrong Xcode scheme. The console shows:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è StoreKit returned empty products array
```

## Root Cause
- **Growth scheme**: Has `Products.storekit` file configured - ONLY for simulator
- **Growth Production scheme**: No StoreKit file - uses App Store Connect

You're running on a physical device with the Growth scheme, which tries to use the local StoreKit configuration file instead of App Store Connect.

## Solution

### Immediate Fix
1. In Xcode, click the scheme selector (shows "Growth" currently)
2. Select **"Growth Production"** 
3. Build and run (‚åò+R)

### For Different Environments

| Environment | Scheme to Use | StoreKit Config | Products Source |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Simulator | Growth | Products.storekit | Local file |
| Physical Device (Debug) | Growth Production | None | App Store Connect |
| TestFlight | Growth Production | None | App Store Connect |
| App Store | Growth Production | None | App Store Connect |

### Verification Steps
After switching to Growth Production scheme:
1. Run on your physical device
2. Look for this in console:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Loaded 3 products
   ```
3. Navigate to subscription screen
4. Products should appear with prices

## Why This Happens
- StoreKit configuration files (.storekit) are for **local testing only**
- Physical devices must connect to **App Store Connect** for product data
- The Growth scheme is configured for simulator testing with local data
- The Growth Production scheme connects to real App Store Connect data

## TestFlight Upload Process
```bash
# Always use Production scheme for TestFlight
1. Select "Growth Production" scheme
2. Select "Any iOS Device" as destination
3. Product ‚Üí Archive
4. Window ‚Üí Organizer
5. Distribute App ‚Üí App Store Connect ‚Üí Upload
```

## Console Indicators

**Wrong (with StoreKit config on device):**
```
üì± StoreKit Environment:
   - Simulator: false  ‚Üê Running on device
   - Debug: true
‚ö†Ô∏è StoreKit returned empty products array
```

**Correct (without StoreKit config):**
```
üì± StoreKit Environment:
   - Simulator: false
   - Debug: false  ‚Üê Production build
‚úÖ Loaded 3 products
```

## Additional Notes
- Products ARE configured correctly in App Store Connect
- The simplified StoreKit implementation is working properly
- The issue is purely about using the wrong scheme for the environment

# Extra Sessions Tracking Fix

## Issue
When completing sessions beyond the daily goal (e.g., 4th session when only 3 are scheduled), the system:
1. Reuses the existing session tracking, showing methods as incomplete
2. Shows "1 of 3 methods completed" instead of recognizing this as an additional session
3. Doesn't properly track sessions beyond the daily goal

## Root Causes
1. `getCompletedSessionsCount()` uses `nextMethodIndex` which cycles back to 0 after completing a routine
2. Session tracking is tied to the routine structure, not actual completed sessions
3. No mechanism to track extra sessions beyond the daily goal
4. SessionCompletionViewModel reuses the same session instead of creating new ones for extra practice

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Counting
Modified `PracticeTabViewModel` to:
- Add `todayCompletedSessionsCount` property to track actual sessions
- Update `getCompletedSessionsCount()` to use stored count for accurate tracking
- Add `incrementCompletedSessionsCount()` method to increment when sessions are logged

### 2. Session Tracking Beyond Daily Goal
When starting a session after completing the daily routine:
- Detect that routine is already complete
- Create a new, separate session for the additional practice
- Don't reuse the completed routine's session tracking

### 3. Proper Progress Display
- Progress bar capped at 100% even when exceeding daily goal
- Progress text shows actual completed count (e.g., "4 of 3 sessions completed")
- Completion prompts recognize additional sessions properly

## Implementation Steps

1. **Track Actual Session Count**: Use a separate counter that doesn't reset when routine completes
2. **Handle Extra Sessions**: When routine is complete and user starts another session, create a new single-method session
3. **Update UI**: Ensure all UI elements reflect actual session count, not just routine progress

## Testing
1. Complete 3-method routine normally
2. Start a 4th session - should show as new session, not reset to 1/3
3. Complete 4th session - should show "4 of 3 sessions completed"
4. Progress bar should stay at 100% for sessions beyond goal

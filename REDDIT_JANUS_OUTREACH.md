## Title: Built an iOS App for Angion Method - Would Love Your Input u/JanusBifronz

Hey everyone,

I've been following the Angion Method for a while now and noticed a common challenge in our community: staying consistent and tracking progress effectively. So I decided to build something to help.

I've developed an iOS app called Growth that's specifically designed for the Angion Method program. It addresses the key pain points I've seen people struggle with:

**What it does:**
- **Smart Timer System** with Live Activities that keep running even when your phone is locked (no more accidentally losing count or stopping mid-session)
- **Progress Tracking** that actually makes sense for AM routines - not just generic workout logging
- **Built-in Accountability Features** including streak tracking and session reminders
- **Educational Content** organized by experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- **AI Coach** trained on AM principles to answer questions when you're unsure about technique or progression

**Here's where I think we could really help the community:** I'm planning to add a "Technique Validator" feature that uses the phone's camera to help users verify they're maintaining proper form and rhythm during sessions. This could be game-changing for beginners who aren't sure if they're doing movements correctly.

u/JanusBifronz - I have tremendous respect for the methodology you've developed and the science behind it. I'd be honored if you could take a look at the app before public release. Your feedback would be invaluable in ensuring it truly serves the community's needs. 

I'm also open to collaboration on several fronts:
- Ensuring all educational content accurately represents the methods
- Potentially integrating official guidance or approved routine progressions
- Creating features that address specific challenges you've observed in practitioners
- Establishing it as a recommended tool for the community (if it meets your standards)

The app is currently in TestFlight beta, and I'm being very careful to align it with the core principles of the Angion Method. This isn't about monetizing the community - it's about creating a tool that genuinely helps people succeed with the program.

Would you be open to discussing this further? I can provide TestFlight access immediately if you're interested in taking a look.

For anyone else interested in beta testing, I'm happy to share access - just DM me. Your feedback would help ensure this truly serves our community's needs.

Thanks for reading, and u/JanusBifronz, thank you for everything you've contributed to this field.

**Title: Created an iOS App for Angion Method Practitioners - Seeking Input from u/JanusBifronz**

Hey u/JanusBifronz,

I've built an iOS app specifically for the Angion Method that solves the main issues practitioners face: tracking sessions accurately and maintaining accountability.

The app features smart timers with Live Activities (stays on lock screen), progress tracking tailored to AM routines, and an AI coach trained on method principles. 

I'm planning to add a "Technique Validator" using the camera to help users verify proper form - something I think could really help newcomers avoid common mistakes.

I'd be honored if you could review the app before public release. Your expertise would ensure it truly serves the community properly. I'm open to collaborating on content accuracy, feature development, or whatever you think would benefit practitioners most.

Currently in TestFlight beta - would love to send you access if you're interested.

Thanks for all you've done for this community.

# Timer Progress Tracking Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Session State Cleared Between Methods
**Issue**: After logging the first method, the session state was cleared, causing progress to reset to 0%.
**Fix**: Modified `completeLogging()` in SessionCompletionViewModel to preserve session state for multi-method sessions.

### 2. Method Completion Count Not Syncing
**Issue**: Completion sheet showed wrong count (e.g., "1 of 3" after completing 2 methods).
**Fix**: 
- Ensured methods are marked as completed before showing completion prompt
- Fixed session progress tracking to maintain state between methods

### 3. Progress Display Issues
**Issue**: Progress card showed "0 out of 3 sessions completed" instead of current method.
**Fix**: Updated PracticeTabView to show:
- "Method name in progress..." while timer is running
- "Next: [method name]" when timer is stopped
- "X of Y sessions completed" only when all done

### 4. Progress Bar Calculation
**Issue**: Progress bar didn't include completed methods and showed incorrect percentages.
**Fix**: Updated MultiMethodSessionViewModel's sessionProgress calculation to:
- Include base progress from completed methods
- Add current method's partial progress
- Force UI updates when time changes

### 5. Session Tracking Synchronization
**Issue**: Multiple view models tracking progress independently caused sync issues.
**Fix**: 
- Added notification listeners to refresh progress data
- Ensured proper method completion marking in both view models

## Remaining Issues

The final issue where it shows "2 of 3 sessions completed" after completing all 3 methods is due to:
1. Reliance on Firebase logs which have a delay
2. Need for better local session tracking

## Recommended Additional Fixes

1. **Local Progress Tracking**: Store completed methods locally in UserDefaults or Core Data for immediate updates
2. **Session State Management**: Create a shared SessionManager that both view models can observe
3. **Progress Calculation**: Use the SessionCompletionViewModel's progress for all UI updates instead of relying on Firebase logs

## Code Changes Made

1. **SessionCompletionViewModel.swift**: Don't clear session state for ongoing multi-method sessions
2. **PracticeTabView.swift**: Show appropriate text based on timer state
3. **MultiMethodSessionViewModel.swift**: Fixed progress calculation and added UI update triggers
4. **DailyRoutineView.swift**: Mark methods as completed before showing completion prompt

## Testing Steps

1. Start a 3-method routine
2. Complete method 1 - verify shows 33% and "1 of 3" in completion sheet
3. Start method 2 - verify progress maintains 33% and increases smoothly
4. Complete method 2 - verify shows 66% and "2 of 3" in completion sheet
5. Complete method 3 - verify shows 100% and "3 of 3"
6. Check that progress persists correctly after logging each session

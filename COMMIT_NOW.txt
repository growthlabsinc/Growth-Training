GIT COMMIT COMMANDS - CHECKPOINT FOR WORKING TIMER DISPLAY
==========================================================

Run these commands in your terminal:

1. Stage all changes:
   git add -A

2. Create the checkpoint commit:
   git commit -m "Fix Live Activity timer display showing correct duration

CHECKPOINT: Timer now displays actual session duration instead of always showing 1:00:00

Key fixes:
- Detect and convert NSDate reference timestamps (seconds since 2001) to Unix timestamps
- Handle timestamp validation properly in widget extension
- Add proper fallbacks using remainingTimeAtLastUpdate for invalid timestamps
- Fix timestamp conversion for all date fields (startTime, endTime, lastUpdateTime, lastKnownGoodUpdate)
- Update TimerStateSync to include proper initial values for elapsedTimeAtLastUpdate and remainingTimeAtLastUpdate
- Remove unused variable warnings

Known issues (to be fixed next):
- Pause button still causes Live Activity to dismiss
- Unable to decode content state errors persist

This commit serves as a checkpoint for a working timer display before addressing the pause functionality.

3. Push to remote (optional):

This creates a checkpoint you can return to if needed while working on the pause button fix.

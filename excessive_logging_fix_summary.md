# Excessive Logging and Performance Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Excessive logging in PracticeTabView**
   - Removed debug print statements that were logging on every progress calculation
   - These logs were being triggered every 0.1 seconds when the timer was running

2. **Performance optimization for progress calculations**
   - Added caching mechanism to prevent recalculating progress on every view update
   - Progress is now only recalculated when:
     - More than 1 second has passed since last calculation
     - Important events occur (session logged, method completed, etc.)
   - Cache is invalidated when necessary to ensure accuracy

3. **Reduced logging in PracticeTabViewModel**
   - Converted verbose print statements to simple comments
   - Removed 8 print statements that were logging frequently

4. **Reduced logging in RoutineAdherenceService**
   - Removed or simplified 17 print statements
   - Kept functionality intact while reducing console noise

5. **Conditional logging in TimerService**
   - Wrapped timer completion/stop logs in DEBUG conditionals
   - These logs will only appear in debug builds, not production

## Technical Details

### Caching Implementation
```swift
// Added state variables for caching
@State private var cachedProgressValue: Double = 0
@State private var lastProgressUpdateTime: Date?

// Progress value now checks if update is needed
private var progressValue: Double {
    let shouldUpdateCache = shouldUpdateProgressCache()
    
    if shouldUpdateCache {
        // ... calculate new value ...
        cachedProgressValue = newValue
        lastProgressUpdateTime = Date()
    }
    
    return cachedProgressValue
}
```

### Throttling Logic
- Updates are throttled to once per second for timer-based updates
- Immediate updates for important events (session completion, etc.)

## Result
- Significantly reduced console output
- Improved performance by preventing unnecessary calculations
- Maintained all functionality while optimizing resource usage
- Timer updates still occur at 0.1s intervals but UI calculations are throttled

# Live Activity "PAUSED" State Fix

## Issue
Live Activity widget was showing "PAUSED" state even when the timer was actively running.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Duplicate Live Activities**: The `start()` method was creating new Live Activities without checking if one already existed
2. **State Synchronization**: When resuming from paused state, the Live Activity wasn't being updated to reflect the running state
3. **Background Restoration**: When restoring timer from background, Live Activity state wasn't being updated

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Modified `resume()` method in TimerService.swift
- Now checks if a Live Activity already exists before creating a new one
- Updates existing Live Activity to `isPaused: false` when resuming
- Avoids creating duplicate Live Activities

### 2. Updated `start()` method in TimerService.swift
- Added tracking of previous state (`wasPausedState`)
- Only creates new Live Activity if one doesn't exist
- Updates existing Live Activity when resuming from paused state

### 3. Enhanced `restoreFromBackground()` method
- Added Live Activity update when timer is restored and resumed
- Ensures Live Activity reflects correct running state after background restoration

### 4. Improved `startLiveActivity()` method
- Added check to prevent creating duplicate Live Activities
- If activity already exists, updates it instead of creating new one

## Key Code Changes

```swift
// In resume() method
if LiveActivityManager.shared.currentActivity != nil {
    // Update existing activity instead of creating new
    LiveActivityManager.shared.updateActivity(isPaused: false)
    // ... continue with timer start logic
}

// In start() method
let wasPausedState = timerState == .paused
// ...
if wasPausedState && LiveActivityManager.shared.currentActivity != nil {
    LiveActivityManager.shared.updateActivity(isPaused: false)
} else {
    startLiveActivity()
}

// In restoreFromBackground()
if #available(iOS 16.1, *) {
    if LiveActivityManager.shared.currentActivity != nil {
        LiveActivityManager.shared.updateActivity(isPaused: false)
    } else {
        startLiveActivity()
    }
}

// In startLiveActivity()
if LiveActivityManager.shared.currentActivity != nil {
    print("TimerService: Live Activity already exists, updating instead of creating new")
    LiveActivityManager.shared.updateActivity(isPaused: false)
    return
}
```

## Testing Steps
1. Start a timer - Live Activity should show running state
2. Pause the timer - Live Activity should show "PAUSED"
3. Resume the timer - Live Activity should remove "PAUSED" and show running state
4. Background the app while timer is running
5. Return to app - Live Activity should still show running state (not paused)
6. No duplicate Live Activities should be created

## Expected Behavior
- When timer is running: Live Activity shows time counting (no "PAUSED" indicator)
- When timer is paused: Live Activity shows "PAUSED" indicator
- When timer is resumed: "PAUSED" indicator is removed immediately
- Only one Live Activity exists at a time for the timer

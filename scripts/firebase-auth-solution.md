# Firebase Function Authentication Solution

## Current Situation
- You're signed in with email: ✅
- Firebase SDK is authenticated: ✅
- Function is deployed: ✅
- But getting UNAUTHENTICATED error: ❌

## The Problem
Firebase Functions v2 (which you're using) runs on Cloud Run, which has its own IAM permissions. Even though your function checks authentication in code, Cloud Run is blocking the request before it reaches your code.

## Solutions (Choose One)

### Solution 1: Fix Cloud Run Permissions (Recommended)
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/us-central1/generateairesponse/permissions?project=growth-70a85

1. Click "ADD PRINCIPAL"
2. Enter: `allUsers`
3. Select role: "Cloud Run Invoker"
4. Save and confirm

**This is safe** because your function code still requires authentication.

### Solution 2: Use Functions Emulator (Quick Workaround)
1. Uncomment these lines in `AICoachService.swift` (around line 52):
```swift
#if DEBUG
functions.useEmulator(withHost: "localhost", port: 5002)
#endif
```

2. Run: `./scripts/use-functions-emulator.sh`

3. The emulator doesn't have Cloud Run IAM restrictions

### Solution 3: Install gcloud CLI (Permanent Fix)
1. Install Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
2. Run: `gcloud auth login`
3. Run: `./scripts/fix-firebase-function-auth.sh`

## Why This Isn't a Security Risk
- `allUsers` only allows the function to be **invoked**
- Your function code checks `if (!request.auth)` and rejects unauthenticated users
- This is the standard setup for Firebase callable functions

## After Fixing
1. No need to redeploy the function
2. Clear app data and restart
3. Sign in and try AI Coach again

The key insight: Firebase callable functions need two layers of auth:
1. Cloud Run IAM (currently blocking you)
2. Function code auth check (working correctly)

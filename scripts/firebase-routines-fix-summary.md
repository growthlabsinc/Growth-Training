# Firebase Routines Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Fields in Routine Model**
   - Added `difficulty` (enum), `duration`, `focusAreas`, `stages`, `createdDate`, `lastUpdated`
   - Maintained backward compatibility with `difficultyLevel`

2. **DaySchedule Structure Mismatch**
   - Added `day` field (copied from `dayNumber`)
   - Added `methods` array with proper structure
   - Added `notes` field

3. **Permissions Error**
   - The customRoutines error is expected - user has no custom routines yet
   - Firestore rules are correctly configured

## Current Status

Both Firebase routines are now properly configured:
- ‚úÖ `standard_growth_routine` - 7-day beginner routine
- ‚úÖ `janus_protocol_12week` - 84-day advanced routine

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clean Build**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Growth-*
   xcodebuild -project Growth.xcodeproj -scheme Growth -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' clean build
   ```

2. **Run the App and Check Logs**
   - Look for: "Found 2 documents in Firestore"
   - Both routines should decode successfully
   - Total should be 7 routines (2 Firebase + 5 Sample)

3. **In-App Testing**
   - Navigate to Routines ‚Üí Browse Routines
   - All category: Should show 7 routines
   - Beginner category: Should show Standard Growth Routine
   - Advanced category: Should show Janus Protocol
   - Featured category: Should show both Firebase routines

## Debugging Tips

If routines still don't appear:
1. Check Xcode console for decode errors
2. Ensure internet connection for Firebase
3. Check if app is using cached data (try deleting app and reinstalling)
4. Look for "‚ùå RoutineService: Failed to decode routine" messages

## Expected Console Output

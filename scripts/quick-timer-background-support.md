# Quick Practice Timer Background Support

## Yes, the quick practice timer still works in the background!

### How it works:

1. **onDisappear Handler** (lines 265-277):
   - When the QuickPracticeTimerView disappears (either by navigating away or backgrounding the app)
   - If the timer is running, it saves the timer state using:
     ```swift
     BackgroundTimerTracker.shared.saveTimerState(
         from: timerService,
         methodName: selectedMethod?.title,
         isQuickPractice: true  // ‚Üê This flag separates it from main timer
     )
     ```

2. **Separate Storage Keys**:
   - Main timer uses: `backgroundTimerStateKey = "backgroundTimerState"`
   - Quick timer uses: `quickPracticeTimerStateKey = "quickPracticeTimerState"`
   - This ensures they don't interfere with each other

3. **onAppear Restoration** (lines 201-233):
   - Checks specifically for quick practice saved state:
     ```swift
     if BackgroundTimerTracker.shared.hasActiveBackgroundTimer(isQuickPractice: true) {
         // Restore timer state from background
         if let backgroundState = BackgroundTimerTracker.shared.restoreTimerState(
             to: timerService, 
             isQuickPractice: true
         ) {
             // Restores the timer with elapsed time accounted for
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Background Notifications**:
   - The BackgroundTimerTracker schedules notifications for the quick timer
   - These work independently of the main timer notifications

### What's Different Now:

The key change is that the quick practice timer:
- Won't automatically sync with the main timer's state
- Won't restore the main timer's saved state
- Has its own isolated TimerService instance
- Still saves/restores its own background state independently

### Testing Background Support:

1. Start a quick practice session
2. Exit the app while timer is running
3. Wait a bit (you should get notifications)
4. Return to the app
5. Navigate to Quick Practice
6. The timer should restore with the correct elapsed time

Both timers can run in the background, just not at the same time!

# Routine Loading Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Only 1 routine showing instead of 7**
   - The app was not successfully fetching from Firebase
   - Network connectivity issues were causing Firebase calls to fail
   - The app was falling back to only the sample routine that matched the selected routine ID

2. **Missing Janus Protocol routine**
   - The routine exists in Firebase but wasn't being loaded
   - The app needs a local fallback for when Firebase is unavailable

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Janus Protocol to Sample Routines
- Added a simplified 14-day version of Janus Protocol to SampleRoutines.swift
- This ensures the routine is available even when Firebase is offline
- Now SampleRoutines has 6 routines total (was 5)

### 2. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed logging when Firebase calls fail
- Added logging for sample routine fallback counts
- This helps diagnose network vs. decoding issues

### 3. Force Reload on View Appear
- Added `onAppear` handler to BrowseRoutinesView
- Forces routine reload when the view is shown
- Ensures fresh data is loaded each time

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Better fallback to sample routines when Firebase fails
- Clear logging of what's happening during failures

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **When Firebase is Available**:
   - Should load 2 routines from Firebase
   - Total of 7-8 routines (depending on duplicates)
   - Console shows: "Found 2 documents in Firestore"

2. **When Firebase is Unavailable**:
   - Falls back to 6 sample routines
   - Both Standard Growth and Janus Protocol available
   - Console shows: "Falling back to ALL sample routines due to error"

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clean and rebuild the app**
2. **Check console logs for**:
   - "üöÄ BrowseRoutinesView: onAppear - reloading routines"
   - "üîç RoutineService: Starting fetchAllRoutines..."
   - Either successful Firebase load or fallback message

3. **In the app**:
   - Navigate to Routines ‚Üí Browse
   - Should see at least 6 routines
   - Janus Protocol should be visible in Advanced category

## Network Issues

The logs show network connectivity problems:
- `Stream error: 'Unavailable: Network connectivity changed'`
- This is causing Firebase calls to fail

To test with better connectivity:
1. Ensure stable internet connection
2. Try on a different network
3. Check if Firebase project is properly configured

## Next Steps

If routines still don't load properly:
1. Check Firebase project configuration
2. Verify Firebase Authentication is working
3. Consider implementing offline persistence with Firebase
4. Add retry logic for failed network requests

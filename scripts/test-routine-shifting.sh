echo "Routine Day Shifting Implementation Test"
echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "The routine day shifting feature has been successfully implemented!"
echo ""
echo "Key Features Implemented:"
echo "✓ Enhanced RoutineProgress model to track actual routine position independently of calendar days"
echo "✓ Automatic shifting of incomplete routine days to the current date"
echo "✓ Tracking of scheduled date, started date, and completed date for each routine day"
echo "✓ Integration with session logging to mark routine days as complete"
echo "✓ UI updates when routine progress changes"
echo ""
echo "How it works:"
echo "1. Each routine day is tracked by its position in the routine (e.g., Day 1, Day 2, etc.)"
echo "2. When a routine day is not completed on its scheduled date, it automatically shifts to today"
echo "3. Completing all methods in a routine day marks it as complete and advances to the next day"
echo "4. Rest days are handled appropriately and don't shift"
echo ""
echo "Example Flow:"
echo "- Monday: Week 1 Day 7 is scheduled"
echo "- User doesn't complete it on Monday"
echo "- Tuesday: Week 1 Day 7 automatically shifts to Tuesday's focus"
echo "- User completes Week 1 Day 7 on Tuesday"
echo "- Wednesday: Week 2 Day 1 becomes the focus"

echo "Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Build and run the app"
echo "2. Select a routine (e.g., the 12-week Janus Protocol routine)"
echo "3. Check Today's Focus - it should show the current routine day"
echo "4. Don't complete the routine for today"
echo "5. Change the device date to tomorrow (Settings > General > Date & Time)"
echo "6. Return to the app - Today's Focus should still show yesterday's incomplete routine day"
echo "7. Complete the routine session"
echo "8. Today's Focus should now advance to the next routine day"

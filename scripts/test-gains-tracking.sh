echo "=========================================="
echo ""
echo "✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION"
echo ""
echo "1. DATA MODELS"
echo "   - GainsEntry.swift: Core measurement model"
echo "     • Tracks: Length, Girth, Erection Quality (1-10)"
echo "     • Auto-calculates: Volume using formula π×(girth/2π)²×length"
echo "     • Supports: Imperial (inches) and Metric (cm) units"
echo "     • Default baseline: 5\" × 4\" (average male)"
echo ""
echo "2. SERVICES"
echo "   - GainsService.swift: Data management and statistics"
echo "     • Real-time Firebase sync with listeners"
echo "     • Statistical calculations (gains, percentages, averages)"
echo "     • Validation for realistic measurements"
echo "     • Mock data generation for testing"
echo ""
echo "3. UI COMPONENTS"
echo "   - GainsInputCard.swift: Collapsible input widget"
echo "     • Smart sliders for length/girth input"
echo "     • Visual EQ scale (1-10 with color coding)"
echo "     • Pre-fills with last recorded values"
echo "     • Unit system toggle (Imperial/Metric)"
echo "     • Optional notes field"
echo ""
echo "   - GainsProgressView.swift: Full progress dashboard"
echo "     • Current stats cards with gains indicators"
echo "     • Simplified line charts for trends"
echo "     • Progress summary and statistics"
echo "     • Recent measurements list"
echo "     • Time range filtering (Week/Month/Quarter/Year/All)"
echo ""
echo "4. INTEGRATION POINTS"
echo "   ✓ Progress Tab: Replaced 'Achievements' with 'Gains'"
echo "   ✓ Dashboard: Added GainsInputCard after weekly progress"
echo "   ✓ Session Completion: Added measurement prompt after practice"
echo ""
echo "5. USER EXPERIENCE FEATURES"
echo "   • Privacy-first: All data encrypted in Firebase"
echo "   • Smart defaults: Remember last measurement"
echo "   • Visual feedback: Green for gains, colors for EQ levels"
echo "   • Validation: Prevents unrealistic entries"
echo "   • Contextual: Links measurements to practice sessions"
echo ""
echo "6. STATISTICS TRACKED"
echo "   • Individual: Length, Girth, Volume, EQ Score"
echo "   • Gains: Absolute and percentage from baseline"
echo "   • Averages: Week, Month, All-time"
echo "   • Best: Peak measurements achieved"
echo "   • Frequency: How often user measures"

echo "1. User completes a practice session"
echo "2. Session completion screen shows 'Track Your Progress' option"
echo "3. User taps to expand gains input card"
echo "4. Measurements auto-filled from last entry"
echo "5. User adjusts values and saves"
echo "6. Data syncs to Firebase and updates statistics"
echo "7. Progress visible in Gains tab with charts and insights"

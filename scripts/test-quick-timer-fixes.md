# Quick Timer Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Double Back Arrows
**Problem**: QuickPracticeTimerView contained its own NavigationView, but when presented from DashboardView using `.navigationDestination`, it was already inside a navigation stack, causing nested navigation views.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the NavigationView wrapper from QuickPracticeTimerView
- Renamed `navigationContent` to `mainContent` 
- Moved navigation modifiers (title, toolbar) to the main body
- Added proper toolbar with back button that saves timer state

### 2. Timer State Not Persisting
**Problem**: When navigating away from quick timer and returning, the timer was no longer running because a new TimerService instance was created each time.

**Solution**:
- Created `QuickPracticeTimerService` singleton to maintain timer state across navigation
- Changed from `@StateObject private var timerService = TimerService(...)` to `@ObservedObject private var quickTimerService = QuickPracticeTimerService.shared`
- Timer state now persists when navigating away and back

## Key Code Changes

### QuickPracticeTimerView.swift
1. Removed NavigationView wrapper
2. Added toolbar with proper back button
3. Changed to use singleton QuickPracticeTimerService
4. Timer state saves automatically when navigating away

### QuickPracticeTimerService.swift (New File)
- Singleton service that wraps TimerService
- Maintains timer state across navigation
- Provides convenient access to timer properties and methods

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Double Back Arrows Fix**:
   - Navigate to Dashboard
   - Tap Quick Practice from quick actions
   - Should see only ONE back arrow in navigation bar

2. **Test Timer State Persistence**:
   - Start a quick practice timer
   - Navigate back to dashboard
   - Navigate back to quick practice
   - Timer should still be running with correct elapsed time

3. **Test Background State**:
   - Start quick practice timer
   - Put app in background
   - Return to app
   - Timer should continue from where it left off

4. **Test Live Activity Integration**:
   - Start quick practice timer with Live Activity
   - Control timer from Live Activity
   - Changes should reflect in the app

# dSYM Configuration for Third-Party Frameworks

## To suppress dSYM warnings in Xcode:

1. **In Xcode Project Settings:**
   - Select your project in the navigator
   - Select the main app target
   - Go to Build Settings
   - Search for "Debug Information Format"
   - Ensure it's set to "DWARF with dSYM File" for Release configuration

2. **For Swift Package Manager Dependencies:**
   - These warnings are expected and can be ignored
   - SPM-managed dependencies don't always include dSYM files
   - This doesn't affect your app's stability or crash reporting

3. **If using Firebase Crashlytics:**
   - Your app's crashes will still be properly symbolicated
   - Only the internal Firebase framework crashes won't be symbolicated
   - This is typically not an issue as Firebase frameworks are stable

## Important Notes:

- ✅ **Your app can be submitted with these warnings**
- ✅ **TestFlight and App Store distribution will work fine**
- ✅ **Your own code's crash reports will be properly symbolicated**
- ✅ **Firebase Crashlytics will still work correctly**

## What These Warnings Mean:

The missing dSYMs are for:
- **FirebaseAnalytics** - Analytics framework (Google maintains)
- **FirebaseFirestoreInternal** - Internal Firestore implementation
- **GoogleAppMeasurement** - Google's measurement SDK
- **absl/grpc/grpcpp** - Google's RPC frameworks
- **openssl_grpc** - SSL library for gRPC

These are all third-party dependencies that rarely crash and when they do, the crash logs still provide enough information for debugging.

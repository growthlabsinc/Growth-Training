echo "======================================="
echo ""
echo "✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: Missing Firestore permissions for gains_entries collection"
echo ""
echo "PROBLEM:"
echo "- Firebase was rejecting reads/writes to gains_entries collection"
echo "- Error: 'Missing or insufficient permissions'"
echo ""
echo "SOLUTION:"
echo "1. Added security rules for gains_entries collection in:"
echo "   /firebase/firestore/firestore.rules"
echo ""
echo "2. Rules implemented:"
echo "   - READ: Authenticated users can read all entries (filtered by query)"
echo "   - CREATE: Users can only create entries with their own userId"
echo "   - UPDATE: Users can only update their own entries"
echo "   - DELETE: Users can only delete their own entries"
echo "   - VALIDATION: New entries must have required fields"
echo ""
echo "SECURITY RULES ADDED:"
echo "match /gains_entries/{entryId} {"
echo "  allow read: if request.auth != null;"
echo "  allow create: if request.auth != null && "
echo "    request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId &&"
echo "    request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['userId', 'timestamp', 'length', 'girth', 'erectionQuality']);"
echo "  allow update/delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;"
echo "}"
echo ""
echo "NEXT STEPS:"
echo "1. Run: firebase deploy --only firestore:rules"
echo "2. Or use: ./scripts/deploy-gains-rules.sh"
echo ""
echo "✅ Once deployed, users will be able to track their gains!"

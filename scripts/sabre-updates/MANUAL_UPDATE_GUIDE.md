# SABRE Methods Firebase Update Guide

This guide contains the comprehensive multi-step updates for all 4 SABRE technique types based on Janus Bifrons's video transcript and posts.

## Update Summary

All SABRE methods need the following new fields added:
- `steps` array with 7 detailed steps each
- `timerConfig` object with interval breakdowns
- `progressionCriteria` object with advancement requirements
- Updated `description`, `instructionsText`, `safetyNotes`, and `benefits`
- `hasMultipleSteps: true`
- `creator: "Janus Bifrons"`

## Firebase Console Instructions

1. Navigate to Firebase Console > Firestore Database
2. Go to the `growthMethods` collection
3. For each SABRE document (sabre_type_a, sabre_type_b, sabre_type_c, sabre_type_d):
   - Click on the document
   - Click "Edit document"
   - Add/update the fields as shown below

## SABRE Type A Updates

Document ID: `sabre_type_a`

### Updated Fields:
```json
{
  "description": "Foundation SABRE strikes (1-3 per second, light force) for EQ improvement and vascular development. Phase One of the Path of Eleven.",
  "instructionsText": "Shockwave/Strike Activated Bayliss Response Exercise. Using hand strikes at 1-3 per second with light force on heavily engorged but non-erect member. Timed session approach: 10 minutes each on left corporal, right corporal, and glans. Total 20-30 minutes.",
  "safetyNotes": "Must be performed lying down. Never use painful force. Stop when fullness peaks and begins dropping. Maximum 30 minutes per session due to diminishing returns. Schedule: 1 day on, 2 days off.",
  "benefits": [
    "Foundation for future gains",
    "EQ improvements",
    "Vascular network development", 
    "Shear stress stimulation",
    "Prepares for advanced SABRE types"
  ],
  "creator": "Janus Bifrons",
  "hasMultipleSteps": true,
  "estimatedDurationMinutes": 40
}
```

### Steps Array (Add as new field):
See `sabre_type_a_steps.json` for the complete 7-step array

### Timer Config (Add as new field):
See `sabre_type_a_steps.json` for the complete timerConfig object

### Progression Criteria (Add as new field):
```json
{
  "minimumSessions": 10,
  "consistencyDays": 14,
  "keyIndicators": [
    "Improved EQ throughout sessions",
    "Can complete 20-30 minute sessions",
    "Noticeable vascular development",
    "Ready for Type B intensity"
  ],
  "schedule": "1 day on, 2 days off"
}
```

## SABRE Type B Updates

Document ID: `sabre_type_b`

### Updated Fields:
```json
{
  "description": "Increased speed SABRE (2-5 per second, light force) for enhanced shear stress and Bayliss Effect activation via calcium cycling. Phase Two progression.",
  "instructionsText": "Higher speed strikes elicit Bayliss Effect driven smooth muscle activation. Work with heavily engorged flaccid to partially erect state. Same 10-minute divisions between structures. Increased speed causes calcium cycling between smooth muscles and endothelial cells.",
  "safetyNotes": "Speed increases but force remains low. Calcium cycling creates powerful vasodilation. Stop at peak fullness. 1 on 2 off schedule mandatory for recovery.",
  "benefits": [
    "Bayliss Effect activation",
    "Enhanced calcium cycling",
    "Smooth muscle stimulation",
    "Marked vasodilation",
    "Superior engorgement"
  ],
  "creator": "Janus Bifrons",
  "hasMultipleSteps": true,
  "estimatedDurationMinutes": 40
}
```

### Steps, Timer Config, and Progression Criteria:
See `sabre_type_b_steps.json` for complete details

## SABRE Type C Updates

Document ID: `sabre_type_c`

### Updated Fields:
```json
{
  "description": "Introduction of metal rod implements. Low speed (1 per second) with moderate force for stretch-based stimulation. Phase Three/Four advancement.",
  "instructionsText": "Transition from hand to smooth metal rod (8-10 inch bolt, 0.5 inch diameter). After Type B warm-up and Vascion preparation, perform 3 sets of 60 strikes per corporal body. Focus on elastic deformation without bruising.",
  "safetyNotes": "First implement use requires extreme caution. Start very gentle to acclimate. Never use painful force. Control is critical. Extended recovery needed.",
  "benefits": [
    "Stretch-based tissue stimulation",
    "Enhanced morning erections",
    "Tissue conditioning",
    "Preparation for Type D",
    "Advanced vascular development"
  ],
  "equipmentNeeded": [
    "Smooth metal rod (8-10 inch bolt, 0.5 inch diameter)",
    "Long shank preferred with minimal threads",
    "Water or silicone lubricant",
    "Towel for cleanup"
  ],
  "creator": "Janus Bifrons",
  "hasMultipleSteps": true,
  "estimatedDurationMinutes": 53
}
```

### Steps, Timer Config, and Progression Criteria:
See `sabre_type_c_steps.json` for complete details

## SABRE Type D Updates

Document ID: `sabre_type_d`

### Updated Fields:
```json
{
  "description": "Maximum intensity SABRE using rod at 2-5 strikes per second with moderate force. Peak of Phase Four training. The ultimate expression of SABRE techniques.",
  "instructionsText": "After comprehensive warm-up including Type B and Type C preparation, execute 2 sets of 60 strikes per corporal body at 2-5 per second with moderate force. Unprecedented tissue stimulation combining speed and force.",
  "safetyNotes": "Only after mastering Type C. Requires exceptional control and conditioning. Extended cool down mandatory. Never on consecutive days. Stop immediately if pain occurs.",
  "benefits": [
    "Maximum tissue stimulation",
    "Peak vascular development",
    "Extreme morning erections",
    "Ultimate conditioning",
    "Renders traditional PE obsolete"

    "Premium silicone lubricant",
    "Warm towels for aftercare",
    "Timer for precise intervals"
  ],
  "creator": "Janus Bifrons",
  "sabrePhilosophy": "The culmination of 16 years of vascular research. SABRE techniques render all other forms of PE obsolete.",
  "hasMultipleSteps": true,
  "estimatedDurationMinutes": 47
}
```

# SABRE Methods Update - Deployment Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Comprehensive Multi-Step Instructions
Based on Janus Bifrons's video transcript and posts, I created detailed 7-step instructions for all 4 SABRE types:

- **SABRE Type A**: Foundation strikes (1-3/sec, low force)
- **SABRE Type B**: High speed strikes (2-5/sec, low force) 
- **SABRE Type C**: Rod strikes (1/sec, moderate force)
- **SABRE Type D**: Maximum intensity (2-5/sec rod strikes)

### 2. Key Updates Added

Each SABRE method now includes:
- **7 Detailed Steps** with:
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Duration for each step
  - Tips and warnings
  - Intensity levels
- **Timer Configurations** with:
  - Named intervals
  - Preparation, work, and rest phases
  - Total duration (40-53 minutes)
- **Progression Criteria** with:
  - Minimum sessions required
  - Key indicators for advancement
  - Scheduling (1 on, 2 off)
- **Enhanced Descriptions** explaining:
  - Bayliss Effect activation
  - Calcium cycling mechanisms
  - Shear stress stimulation
  - Vascular development

### 3. Files Created

1. **Individual Step Files**:
   - `sabre_type_a_steps.json` - Complete Type A steps
   - `sabre_type_b_steps.json` - Complete Type B steps
   - `sabre_type_c_steps.json` - Complete Type C steps
   - `sabre_type_d_steps.json` - Complete Type D steps

2. **Consolidated Update File**:
   - `all-sabre-updates.json` - All 4 types in one file

3. **Deployment Scripts**:
   - `firebase-update-commands.js` - Admin SDK update script
   - `MANUAL_UPDATE_GUIDE.md` - Manual Firebase Console instructions

### 4. Current Status

The SABRE documents exist in Firebase's `growthMethods` collection but need the multi-step updates applied. The Firebase MCP tools don't support document updates, so I've prepared:

1. **Option 1**: Use the Admin SDK script (`firebase-update-commands.js`)
2. **Option 2**: Manual update via Firebase Console using `MANUAL_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`
3. **Option 3**: Deploy a Cloud Function to perform updates

### 5. Key Improvements from Video Transcript

Based on Janus's detailed explanations:
- Added specific warm-up sequences (Type B warm-up for C/D)
- Included Vascion preparation for Types C/D
- Clarified strike counts (60 per corporal per set)
- Added equipment specifications (8-10" bolt, 0.5" diameter)
- Emphasized safety protocols and recovery times
- Explained physiological mechanisms (Bayliss Effect, calcium cycling)

### Next Steps

To complete the deployment:
1. Choose deployment method (Admin SDK, Console, or Cloud Function)
2. Apply updates to all 4 SABRE documents
3. Verify `steps` arrays and `timerConfig` objects are properly saved
4. Test in the app to ensure multi-step display works correctly

All preparation work is complete and ready for deployment!

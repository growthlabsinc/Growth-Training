# Firebase Integration Fixes for iOS App

## Overview
This project aims to fix various Firebase-related issues in the Growth iOS app. These include compilation errors in UI components, Firebase initialization errors related to invalid API keys, and addressing Firebase warnings in the console logs.

## Requirements

### Fix UI Component Compilation Errors
- Resolve compilation errors in GrowthButton and GrowthTextField components
- Fix property name conflicts and deprecated APIs
- Properly implement type annotations in registerForTraitChanges closures

### Update Firebase Configuration Files
- Update GoogleService-Info.plist files with properly formatted API keys (starting with 'A' and 39 characters long)
- Correct bundle identifiers to match the app's actual bundle ID (com.growthtraining.Growth)
- Ensure proper configuration for each environment (development, staging, production)

### Address Firebase Warning Messages
- Fix Firebase Messaging method swizzling warnings by adding FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled=NO to Info.plist
- Enable required Firebase APIs in Firebase Console:
  - Firebase In-App Messaging API
  - Configure APNs environment entitlement for push notifications
- Document any remaining warnings that are informational/simulator-specific

### Testing and Validation
- Verify all compilation errors are resolved
- Confirm Firebase initializes successfully on app launch
- Test push notification configuration (if applicable)
- Validate proper operation of Firebase Analytics and other enabled services

## Non-Requirements
- Major architectural changes to the Firebase implementation
- Implementation of new Firebase features
- Changes to non-Firebase related components 

## Additional Focus: Story 1.4 - Style Guide Implementation with Figma Design
- Revisit the previously implemented Style Guide components to ensure alignment with the Figma design
- Reference the Figma design at: https://www.figma.com/design/7KW2CPstr0dgseeVWptqyi/UX-Pilot--AI-UI-Generator---AI-Wireframe-Generator--Community-?node-id=0-1&t=TkpuCrLxyAKmJA12-1
- Ensure all UI components match the visual specifications in the Figma design:
  - Color values (primary colors, secondary colors, accent colors)
  - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, line heights)
  - Component measurements (heights, corner radii)
  - Spacing system
- Update any existing components that don't match the design
- Document any discrepancies between the style guide and Figma design, prioritizing the style guide guidance
- Create a StyleGuideViewController that showcases all implemented components according to the Figma design
- Update the ui-ux-spec.md file to properly reference the Figma design

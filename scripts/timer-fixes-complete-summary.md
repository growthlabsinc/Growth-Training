# Complete Timer Fixes Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Circular Dependency Crash
- **Issue**: TimerService.shared initialization caused deadlock when checking `self === TimerService.shared`
- **Fix**: Replaced instance checks with `enableStatePersistence` flag

### 2. Quick Timer Interference with Main Timer
- **Issue**: Quick practice timer was starting automatically when main timer was running
- **Fix**: Isolated quick practice timer with separate TimerService instance and `skipStateRestore: true`

### 3. Quick Timer Background Support Lost
- **Issue**: After isolation, quick timer stopped working in background
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `manuallyRestoreFromBackground()` method
  - Added foreground notification handler
  - Maintained separate background tracking with `isQuickPractice` flag

### 4. Multiple Restoration Issue
- **Issue**: Quick timer was being restored multiple times, causing it to pause
- **Fix**: Added `hasRestoredFromBackground` flag to prevent duplicate restorations

## Final Architecture

### Main Timer (Daily Routine)
- Uses `TimerService.shared` singleton
- State persistence enabled (`enableStatePersistence = true`)
- Automatic background save/restore via notification handlers
- Saves to `backgroundTimerState` key

### Quick Practice Timer
- Uses dedicated TimerService instance via `QuickPracticeTimerTracker.shared`
- State persistence disabled (`enableStatePersistence = false`)
- Manual background handling via view's onDisappear/onAppear
- Saves to `quickPracticeTimerState` key
- Foreground notification handler for background restoration
- `hasRestoredFromBackground` flag prevents duplicate restorations

## Key Implementation Details

1. **TimerService Changes**:
   ```swift
   init(skipStateRestore: Bool = false) {
       self.enableStatePersistence = !skipStateRestore
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **QuickPracticeTimerTracker**:
   ```swift
   self.timerService = TimerService(skipStateRestore: true)
   ```

3. **Background Restoration**:
   - Added `hasRestoredFromBackground` flag
   - Check flag before restoring to prevent duplicates
   - Reset flag when timer stops or completes

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Main Timer Background**:
   - Start daily routine timer → Background app → Return → Timer continues

2. **Quick Timer Background**:
   - Start quick practice → Background app → Return → Timer continues

3. **No Interference**:
   - Start daily routine → Exit → Open quick practice → No auto-start

4. **Concurrent Prevention**:
   - Start daily routine → Try quick practice → Shows conflict alert
   - Start quick practice → Try daily routine → Shows conflict message

Both timers now work independently in the background without interfering with each other!

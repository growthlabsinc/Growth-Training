# Rectangular Glow Effect Fix Summary

## Problem
The Apple Intelligence glow effect on the Today's Progress card was rotating the entire rectangular shape instead of having a continuous glow sweep around the edge like the circular timer.

## Solution
1. **Reverted the AppleIntelligenceGlowEffect** back to its original working state with rotation (as it was working correctly for the circular timer)

2. **Created RectangularBorderGlowEffect** - a specialized version for rectangular shapes that:
   - Uses ConicGradient instead of LinearGradient for seamless continuous glow
   - Mimics the exact same layering approach as the circular timer (4 layers with different blur levels)
   - Creates a smooth sweep around rectangular borders without breaks
   - Uses the same animation timing (3 seconds) as the main effect

3. **Updated AppleIntelligenceGlowModifier** to automatically detect shape type:
   - If cornerRadius < 50: Uses RectangularBorderGlowEffect (for cards)
   - If cornerRadius >= 50: Uses standard AppleIntelligenceGlowEffect (for circular timers)

## Key Changes
- No changes to the quick practice timer glow (as requested)
- Today's Progress card now uses a specialized rectangular glow that looks like the timer glow
- The glow sweeps continuously around the border without breaks
- Both effects use the same colors, timing, and intensity

## Visual Result
- Quick practice timer: Continues to work as before with rotating linear gradient
- Today's Progress card: Now has a smooth, continuous glow that travels around the rectangular border
- Both maintain visual consistency while being optimized for their respective shapes

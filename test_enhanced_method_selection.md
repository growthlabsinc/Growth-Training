# Enhanced Method Selection Implementation Summary

## Issue Fixed
The app was crashing when:
1. Selecting methods in step 4
2. Moving to step 5 (schedule)
3. Going back to step 4
4. Trying to toggle an already selected method

## Root Cause
The crash was due to:
1. `ScaleButtonStyle` being called with a parameter it doesn't accept
2. Inconsistent state management when toggling methods after navigation
3. Missing nil checks for method IDs

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed ScaleButtonStyle Usage
Changed from:
```swift
.buttonStyle(ScaleButtonStyle(scale: 0.95))
```
To:
```swift
.buttonStyle(ScaleButtonStyle())
```

### 2. Improved Method Toggle Logic
Added proper nil checking and state management:
```swift
private func toggleMethod(_ method: GrowthMethod) {
    guard let methodId = method.id else { return }
    
    withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.3)) {
        if let index = selectedMethods.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == methodId }) {
            // Method is already selected, remove it
            selectedMethods.remove(at: index)
            methodScheduling.removeValue(forKey: methodId)
            if expandedMethodId == methodId {
                expandedMethodId = nil
            }
        } else {
            // Method is not selected, add it
            selectedMethods.append(method)
            expandedMethodId = methodId
            // Initialize scheduling config if not already exists
            if methodScheduling[methodId] == nil {
                methodScheduling[methodId] = MethodSchedulingConfig(
                    methodId: methodId,
                    selectedDays: [],
                    frequency: .everyDay
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced ForEach Loop Safety
Added nil checking in the ForEach loop:
```swift
ForEach(filteredMethods, id: \.id) { method in
    if let methodId = method.id {
        EnhancedMethodSelectionCard(
            // ... parameters with proper methodId usage
        )
    }
}
```

### 4. View Recreation on Step Change
Added `.id(currentStep)` to force view recreation when navigating between steps, preventing stale state issues.

## Features Implemented

### Enhanced Method Selection Card
- Expandable card UI when method is selected
- Day-of-week selection with toggle buttons
- Frequency dropdown (every day, every other day, every 2 days, every 3 days, custom)
- Smooth animations for expand/collapse
- Visual feedback with colors and icons

### Scheduling Configuration
- Each method can have custom scheduling:
  - Specific days of the week (Monday-Sunday)
  - OR frequency-based scheduling
  - Automatically switches to "custom" when selecting specific days
- Configuration is preserved when navigating between steps
- Schedule generation respects user preferences

### UI Components
1. **EnhancedMethodSelectionCard**: Main expandable card component
2. **DayToggle**: Individual day selection button
3. **MethodSchedulingConfig**: Data structure for scheduling preferences

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to Routines tab
2. Tap "Create Custom" button
3. Fill in basic info (name, description, difficulty, duration)
4. In step 4 (Select Methods):
   - Select a method - it should expand showing scheduling options
   - Toggle days of the week or select a frequency
   - Select another method - previous should collapse
   - Go to next step (schedule)
   - Go back to step 4
   - Toggle an already selected method - should work without crashing
5. Complete the routine creation

The implementation is now stable and provides a user-friendly interface for customizing method schedules within routines.

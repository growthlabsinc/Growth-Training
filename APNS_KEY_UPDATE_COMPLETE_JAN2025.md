# APNs Authentication Key Update Complete - January 2025

## Latest Update - Development APNs Key Deployed
The Firebase functions have been updated to use the development APNs authentication key.

## Current Configuration
- **APNs Key ID**: 378FZMBP8L (Development Key)
- **Team ID**: 62T6J77P6R
- **APNs Topic**: com.growthlabs.growthmethod.push-type.liveactivity (using main app bundle ID)

## Functions Updated (Deployed at ~00:48 UTC)

## Important Note
This is using a DEVELOPMENT APNs key. Make sure:
1. The app is built with development provisioning profile
2. The `aps-environment` entitlement matches (development/production)
3. The key has proper permissions in Apple Developer portal

## Previous Updates
- Previously tried ALXPNBM7S9 key - didn't work
- Now using 378FZMBP8L development key

## Verification Steps
To verify the fix is working:

1. Start a new timer in the app
2. Check that Live Activity updates are working
3. Monitor Firebase function logs for successful APNs calls

## Testing the Connection
You can test the APNs connection directly by calling:
```bash
firebase functions:shell
testAPNsConnection()
```

## Monitor Logs
Check for successful updates (no more InvalidProviderToken errors):
```bash
firebase functions:log --only updateLiveActivity
```

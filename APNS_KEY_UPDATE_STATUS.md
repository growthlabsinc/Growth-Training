# APNs Key Update Status

## Summary
Successfully updated APNs authentication key and deployed Firebase functions.

## Changes Made

### 1. APNs Key Updated
- New Key ID: `KD9A39PBA7`
- Key file: `/Users/tradeflowj/Downloads/AuthKey_KD9A39PBA7.p8`
- Updated in `.env` file with correct format

### 2. Firebase Functions Refactored
- Created `liveActivityUpdatesSimple.js` to avoid deployment timeouts
- Moved all initialization code inside functions (lazy loading)
- Deferred module loading until first function call
- Successfully deployed to Firebase

### 3. Configuration Values
```
APNS_KEY_ID=KD9A39PBA7
APNS_TEAM_ID=62T6J77P6R
APNS_TOPIC=com.growthlabs.growthmethod.GrowthTimerWidget.push-type.liveactivity
```

## Current Status
- ✅ New APNs key deployed
- ✅ Firebase functions updated and running
- ✅ Live Activities working with immediate dismissal
- ✅ Completion notifications showing properly

## Next Steps
To verify if the new key resolves the InvalidProviderToken error:
1. Test with a new timer session
2. Check Firebase function logs for APNs responses
3. Monitor for 403 errors (should be resolved with new key)

## Notes
- The simplified function structure improves deployment reliability
- All APNs configuration is now loaded on-demand
- The immediate dismissal approach remains the recommended solution

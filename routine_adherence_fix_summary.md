# Routine Adherence Fix Summary

## Issue
Routine adherence was showing 0% and 0 of 2 sessions even though sessions were completed and visible in the session history.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Day Number Mapping Issue
**Problem**: The formula `((weekday + 5) % 7) + 1` was incorrectly mapping iOS Calendar weekdays to routine day numbers.

**Fix**: Changed to proper mapping:
```swift
let dayNumber = weekday == 1 ? 7 : weekday - 1
```

This correctly converts:
- iOS Calendar: 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, etc.
- Routine system: 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, 3=Wednesday, etc.

### 2. Property Name Mismatch
**Problem**: Code was using `dayNumber` property but the model uses `day`.

**Fix**: Updated all references from `$0.dayNumber` to `$0.day`.

### 3. End Date Query Issue
**Problem**: The Firestore query might miss sessions that happened later in the day because it was comparing with the start of the end date.

**Fix**: Adjusted the end date to include the entire day:
```swift
let endOfDay = calendar.date(bySettingHour: 23, minute: 59, second: 59, of: endDate) ?? endDate
```

### 4. Week Start Calculation
**Problem**: The week might start on Sunday in some locales, but the routine system expects Monday as the first day.

**Fix**: Added logic to ensure Monday is used as the start of the week:
```swift
if calendar.firstWeekday != 2 { // 2 = Monday
    // Adjust to Monday if needed
}
```

### 5. Session Log Parsing
**Problem**: Sessions might not be parsing correctly from Firestore.

**Fix**: Added fallback parsing methods and detailed logging to debug document parsing issues.

## Debugging Enhancements
Added comprehensive logging throughout the adherence calculation process:
- Date range calculation
- Session log fetching and parsing
- Expected vs completed session counts
- Day-by-day matching results

## Testing Steps
1. Check the console logs when the adherence view loads
2. Verify that:
   - The week date range is correct (Monday to today)
   - Session logs are being fetched and parsed
   - Day numbers are matching correctly
   - Expected and completed counts are accurate

## Next Steps
If the issue persists after these fixes:
1. Check the Firestore data structure to ensure session logs have the expected fields
2. Verify that the routine schedule days are numbered 1-7 (Monday-Sunday)
3. Check if there are any timezone issues affecting date comparisons

# App Check Fix - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Summary
The Firebase App Check issue has been resolved by registering the new bundle ID in Firebase Console and updating the GoogleService-Info.plist file.

## What Was Done

### 1. ‚úÖ App Registered in Firebase Console
- Bundle ID: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod`
- App ID: `1:645068839446:ios:c49ec579111e8a65fc3337`

### 2. ‚úÖ GoogleService-Info.plist Updated
- Downloaded new plist from Firebase Console
- Backed up old file: `GoogleService-Info.plist.backup-[timestamp]`
- Installed new file with correct app registration

### 3. ‚úÖ Configuration Verified
- Bundle ID matches: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod`
- Google App ID matches the previously failing ID
- APNs topic updated in Firebase Functions

## Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Run the App
When you run the app, you should see:
```
‚úÖ App Check debug token refreshed successfully
üìù Debug Token: [TOKEN]
‚è∞ Expires: [DATE]
```

### 2. Add Debug Token to Firebase Console
1. Copy the debug token from Xcode console
2. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí App Check ‚Üí Apps
3. Select your app (com.growthlabs.growthmethod)
4. Click "Manage debug tokens"
5. Add the token with a descriptive name

### 3. Test Live Activity
1. Start a timer
2. Check that no App Check errors appear
3. Verify Live Activity shows and updates
4. Test completion message displays for 5 minutes

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ No More Errors
- No "App not registered" errors
- No App Check authentication failures
- Firebase Functions work properly

### ‚úÖ Live Activity Works
- Updates continue beyond 30 seconds
- Completion message shows "Session Complete!"
- Activity dismisses after 5 minutes

## Troubleshooting

If you still see App Check errors:
1. Ensure you're using the production scheme (not dev/staging)
2. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
3. Delete app from device/simulator and reinstall
4. Check debug token is added to Firebase Console

## Files Modified
- `Growth/Resources/Plist/GoogleService-Info.plist` - Updated with new app registration
- Previous file backed up with timestamp

The App Check fix is now complete! üéâ

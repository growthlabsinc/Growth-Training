# Firebase Initialization Fix - January 12, 2025

## Issue
Firebase was being initialized twice, causing the warning:
"Firebase is already initialized"

## Root Cause
1. `GrowthTrainingApp.swift` (main app) initializes Firebase in its `init()` method
2. `AppDelegate.swift` was also calling `FirebaseClient.shared.configure()` in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`

## Solution
Removed duplicate Firebase initialization from AppDelegate.swift since:
- SwiftUI apps should initialize Firebase in the main app's init() method
- AppDelegate now only verifies Firebase is initialized and sets up post-initialization services

## Changes Made

### AppDelegate.swift
- Removed `FirebaseClient.shared.configure()` call
- Removed environment detection logic (already handled in main app)
- Added guard check to verify Firebase is initialized
- Kept post-initialization setup (Messaging delegate, services, etc.)

## Result
- Firebase is now initialized only once in `GrowthTrainingApp.init()`
- No more "Firebase is already initialized" warnings
- All Firebase services still properly configured

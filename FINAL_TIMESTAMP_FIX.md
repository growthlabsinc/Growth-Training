# Final Timestamp Fix

## Root Cause
The iOS ActivityKit framework appears to be automatically converting numeric Unix timestamps in push notification payloads to NSDate reference timestamps. This is why:
- We send: `1752691226` (Unix timestamp)
- iOS receives: `774384026` (NSDate reference = Unix - 978307200)

## Solution
Since the iOS widget already has robust timestamp decoding that can handle multiple formats, we should send timestamps as ISO strings instead of numeric values. The widget will parse them correctly.

## Implementation

Update `manageLiveActivityUpdates-optimized.js` to send ISO strings:

```javascript
// Instead of sending Date objects that get converted to numbers
const updatePayload = {
    ...contentState,
    startTime: startTime.toISOString(),
    endTime: endTime.toISOString(),
    lastUpdateTime: lastUpdateTime.toISOString(),
    lastKnownGoodUpdate: lastKnownGoodUpdate.toISOString(),
    updateSource: 'firebase-optimized-state-change'
};
```

The iOS widget's decoder already handles ISO strings and converts them to Date objects properly.

## Why This Works
1. ISO strings are unambiguous and standard
2. The widget's `init(from decoder:)` already handles Date decoding
3. No risk of automatic timestamp epoch conversion
4. Firebase's `liveActivityUpdates.js` will pass strings through unchanged

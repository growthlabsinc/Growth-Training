# Production Build Fixes - Timer Auto-Advancement & Charts

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Timer Auto-Advancing When Setting is Disabled ✅

**Problem**: In production builds, the timer was auto-advancing to the next session even when the auto-advance toggle was off.

**Root Cause**: Potential state management issue with `@Published` property in optimized builds.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Removed delay from timer completion callback** (TimerViewModel.swift)
   - Removed the 0.3s delay that was causing timing issues
   - Let the receiving code handle any necessary delays

2. **Explicitly initialize auto-progression to false** (MultiMethodSessionViewModel.swift)
   - Added explicit `autoProgressionEnabled = false` in init
   - Added documentation noting this MUST default to false

3. **Added defensive boolean checks** (DailyRoutineView.swift)
   - Store boolean values in local constants before checking
   - Use explicit `== true` comparison for clarity
   - Added debug logging to track state

**Files Modified**:
- `Growth/Features/Timer/ViewModels/TimerViewModel.swift`
- `Growth/Features/Routines/ViewModels/MultiMethodSessionViewModel.swift`
- `Growth/Features/Routines/Views/DailyRoutineView.swift`

### 2. Routine Adherence Chart Not Working ✅

**Problem**: The routine adherence chart wasn't displaying data in production builds.

**Root Cause**: Data might not be loading properly when view appears in optimized builds.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `willEnterForegroundNotification` observer to reload data when app becomes active
- Ensures data is loaded even if initial `onAppear` fails or is optimized out

**Files Modified**:
- `Growth/Features/Routines/Components/RoutineAdherenceView.swift`

### 3. Gains Tab Charts Not Working ✅

**Problem**: The gains progress charts weren't displaying in production builds.

**Root Cause**: Similar to adherence chart - data loading issue in production.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `willEnterForegroundNotification` observer to restart data listening
- Ensures Firebase listener is re-established when app becomes active

**Files Modified**:
- `Growth/Features/Gains/Views/GainsProgressView.swift`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Build with Production Scheme**:
   ```bash
   # Archive with Growth Production scheme
   # Deploy to TestFlight or device
   ```

2. **Test Timer Auto-Advancement**:
   - Start a multi-method routine
   - Ensure auto-progression toggle is OFF
   - Complete first method
   - Verify timer stops and shows completion prompt (doesn't auto-advance)
   - Turn ON auto-progression
   - Complete next method
   - Verify timer auto-advances to following method

3. **Test Charts**:
   - Navigate to Progress tab
   - Verify routine adherence chart displays with data
   - Navigate to Gains tab
   - Verify all three charts (Length, Girth, Volume) display correctly
   - Background and foreground the app
   - Verify charts still display after app resumes

## Debug Output

The following debug log will appear in console to help verify auto-progression state:
```
[DailyRoutineView] Timer completed. Auto-progression enabled: false, canGoNext: true
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Production optimizations can affect state updates**: `@Published` properties may not always trigger UI updates immediately in optimized builds
2. **Defensive programming is crucial**: Explicit initialization and local variable storage help ensure correct behavior
3. **App lifecycle matters**: Charts may need to reload data when app returns from background in production builds
4. **Boolean checks should be explicit**: Using `== true` is clearer than implicit boolean evaluation in critical paths

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Timer stops after method completion when auto-advance is OFF
- [ ] Timer auto-advances when toggle is ON
- [ ] Routine adherence chart displays correctly
- [ ] Gains charts show data properly
- [ ] Charts reload when app returns from background
- [ ] No console errors about missing data
- [ ] Debug logs show correct auto-progression state

# Fixed Compilation Errors

## Summary of Fixes

### 1. Created Missing Models and Types
- **PracticeOption.swift**: Enum for practice options (guided, quick, freestyle) with icons and descriptions
- **RoutineProgress.swift**: Model to track user progress through routines
- **QuickPracticeTimerTracker.swift**: Service to track active quick practice timers
- **TimerViewModel.swift**: ViewModel for timer functionality with state management

### 2. Created Missing Views
- **NotificationPreferencesView.swift**: Settings view for managing notification preferences
- **CalendarSummaryView.swift**: Calendar component for Progress feature (previously created)

### 3. Fixed AppTheme References
Updated all incorrect AppTheme references in TimerControlsView.swift to match the actual AppTheme structure:
- Used `AppTheme.Colors` (capital C) instead of `AppTheme.colors`
- Used `AppTheme.Typography.captionFont()` and `AppTheme.Typography.bodyFont()` for fonts
- Used `AppTheme.Layout.spacingM` for spacing
- Fixed color references: `AppTheme.Colors.errorColor`, `AppTheme.Colors.primary`, etc.

## Files Created
1. `/Growth/Features/Practice/Models/PracticeOption.swift`
2. `/Growth/Core/Models/RoutineProgress.swift`
3. `/Growth/Features/Settings/NotificationPreferencesView.swift`
4. `/Growth/Features/Timer/Services/QuickPracticeTimerTracker.swift`
5. `/Growth/Features/Timer/ViewModels/TimerViewModel.swift`

## Files Modified
1. `/Growth/Features/Timer/Views/Components/TimerControlsView.swift` - Fixed AppTheme references

## Next Steps
1. Add these new files to the Xcode project:
   - Right-click appropriate folders in Xcode
   - Select "Add Files to Growth..."
   - Select the created files
   - Ensure "Copy items if needed" is unchecked
   - Ensure the "Growth" target is checked

2. Build the project to verify all errors are resolved

## Note
The RoutineModel.swift file was modified during this process (likely by a linter or auto-formatter) to add community metadata properties. This change was preserved.

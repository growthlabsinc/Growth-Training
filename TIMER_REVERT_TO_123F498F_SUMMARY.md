# Timer and Live Activity Files Reverted to Commit 123f498f

## Summary
Reverted timer and Live Activity pause button related files to their state in commit 123f498f ("Implement proper timer exclusivity with user feedback"). This removes the race condition fixes that were added in later commits.

## Files Reverted

### 1. LiveActivityManagerSimplified.swift
- **Removed**: Debouncing mechanism (activeUpdateTask, performPushUpdate)
- **Removed**: Delays in pauseTimer() method
- **Removed**: Task cancellation support
- **Kept**: Basic pause/resume functionality
- **Kept**: App Group state storage for pause detection
- **Status**: Now uses simpler sendPushUpdate() without race condition prevention

### 2. TimerService.swift
- **Reverted**: To version with basic pause/resume functionality
- **Kept**: Darwin notification handling for widget actions
- **Kept**: Live Activity integration calls
- **Kept**: Background state restoration logic
- **Status**: Works with LiveActivityManagerSimplified for pause/resume

### 3. TimerControlIntent.swift (Widget)
- **Reverted**: To version that posts Darwin notifications
- **Kept**: Support for both iOS 16.x and 17+ 
- **Kept**: Timer type differentiation (main vs quick)
- **Status**: Continues to handle Live Activity button taps

### 4. LiveActivityActionHandler.swift
- **Reverted**: To version that handles deep links
- **Kept**: Cloud function integration for push updates
- **Kept**: Local fallback handling
- **Status**: Ready for Live Activity actions

### 5. updateLiveActivitySimplified.js (Firebase Function)
- **Restored**: Function was deleted in later commits
- **Kept**: Push notification sending logic
- **Kept**: State preservation from Firestore
- **Status**: Handles Live Activity push updates

## What This Means

The code is now back to the state before the race condition fixes were implemented. This means:

1. **Pause button may show race conditions** on iOS 18+ devices where multiple Firebase function calls conflict
2. **Live Activity may show pausedAt: nil** even when timer is paused
3. **No debouncing** to prevent concurrent Firebase updates
4. **Basic functionality works** but without the robustness added in later commits

## Testing Required

1. Test pause button on physical iOS 18+ device
2. Verify if race condition still occurs
3. Check Firebase logs for "GTMSessionFetcher...was already running" errors
4. Monitor Live Activity state updates

## Note

All non-timer related files were left unchanged as requested. Only files directly related to timer and Live Activity pause button functionality were reverted.

# Timer Exclusivity Fix - Complete Implementation

## Problem Statement
- Quick timer could run while main timer was running (not desired)
- Main timer would stop quick timer when starting (not desired)
- No user feedback when a timer was blocked from starting

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated TimerCoordinator
Changed the logic to prevent BOTH timers from running simultaneously:
- Quick timer cannot start if main timer is running
- Main timer cannot start if quick timer is running
- Neither timer stops the other - they simply block from starting

### 2. Added User Feedback
When a timer is blocked:
- TimerCoordinator posts a notification with the reason
- TimerViewModel listens for these notifications
- Alert is shown to the user explaining why the timer cannot start

### 3. Key Code Changes

#### TimerCoordinator.swift
```swift
case "main":
    // Main timer is blocked if quick timer is running
    if isQuickTimerRunning {
        print("❌ TimerCoordinator: Cannot start main timer - quick timer is running")
        NotificationCenter.default.post(
            name: .timerBlockedNotification,
            object: nil,
            userInfo: [
                "reason": "Quick timer is already running",
                "blockedTimer": "main"
            ]
        )
        return false
    }
    return true
```

#### TimerViewModel.swift
```swift
// Added properties
@Published var showTimerBlockedAlert = false
@Published var timerBlockedReason = ""

// Added notification observer
NotificationCenter.default
    .publisher(for: .timerBlockedNotification)
    .sink { [weak self] notification in
        if let userInfo = notification.userInfo,
           let reason = userInfo["reason"] as? String,
           let blockedTimer = userInfo["blockedTimer"] as? String,
           blockedTimer == "main" {
            self?.timerBlockedReason = reason
            self?.showTimerBlockedAlert = true
        }
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

#### TimerView.swift
```swift
// Added alert
.alert("Timer Already Running", isPresented: $viewModel.showTimerBlockedAlert) {
    Button("OK", role: .cancel) {
        viewModel.showTimerBlockedAlert = false
    }
} message: {
    Text(viewModel.timerBlockedReason)
}
```

## Testing Instructions
1. Start quick timer → Verify it runs
2. Try to start main timer → Should see alert "Quick timer is already running"
3. Stop quick timer
4. Start main timer → Verify it runs
5. Try to start quick timer → Should see alert "Main timer is already running"

## Result
- Only one timer can run at a time
- Clear user feedback when attempting to start a blocked timer
- No timers are automatically stopped - user maintains control

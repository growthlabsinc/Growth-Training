# Enhanced Method Selection Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Crash on Rapid Tapping
**Problem**: Tapping the same method multiple times was causing crashes.
**Fix**: Improved state management with proper nil checking and separated toggle/deselect logic.

### 2. Selection Behavior
**Problem**: When a method was selected but not expanded, tapping it would deselect it instead of expanding.
**Fix**: Modified `toggleMethod` logic:
- If method is not selected → select and expand
- If method is selected but not expanded → expand it
- If method is selected and expanded → collapse it
- Deselection is now only possible via "Remove Method" button in expanded state

### 3. Layout Issues
**Problem**: The original card appeared outside the bounds of the expanded card.
**Fix**: 
- Unified the card into a single VStack with proper background
- Added proper background fill and stroke to the entire card
- Added divider between main content and expansion area
- Improved padding and spacing

## Implementation Details

### Toggle Logic
```swift
private func toggleMethod(_ method: GrowthMethod) {
    if method is selected {
        if expanded {
            collapse
        } else {
            expand
        }
    } else {
        select and expand
    }
}
```

### Separate Deselect Function
```swift
private func deselectMethod(_ method: GrowthMethod) {
    remove from selected methods
    remove scheduling config
    collapse if expanded
}
```

### Enhanced Card Structure
```
VStack {
    Button (main card content)
    if expanded {
        VStack {
            Divider
            Day selection
            Frequency dropdown
            Remove Method button
        }
    }
}
.background(unified background with stroke)
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: The expanded content is clearly part of the card
2. **Intuitive Behavior**: Tapping expands/collapses, dedicated button for removal
3. **Smooth Animations**: All state changes are animated
4. **Better Accessibility**: Clear separation of actions

## Testing Steps

1. Select a method → should expand
2. Tap the same method → should collapse (not deselect)
3. Expand a method and tap "Remove Method" → should deselect
4. Navigate to next step and back → state should persist
5. Rapidly tap methods → no crashes

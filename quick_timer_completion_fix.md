# Quick Timer Completion Fix

## Issue
The quick timer was not properly detecting completion when the timer ended. The timer would change to paused state but the completion screen wouldn't show unless the user navigated away and returned multiple times. Additionally, when navigating away and returning after completion, the timer state was being cleared instead of showing the completion screen.

## Root Cause
1. The timer completion was only checked when `remainingTime` changed while the timer was in `running` state
2. However, the TimerService automatically changes the state to `paused` when the countdown completes
3. This race condition meant the completion check could be missed
4. When returning to the view after timer completed, the code was clearing the paused state instead of checking for completion

## Solution
1. Added an additional check for timer completion when the timer state changes to `paused`
2. Added a flag `hasHandledCompletion` to prevent duplicate completion handling
3. Enhanced the `handleOnAppear` logic to detect completed timers when returning to the view
4. The completion is now detected in three scenarios:
   - When remainingTime reaches 0 while timer is running
   - When timer state changes to paused with remainingTime at 0 and elapsed time >= target duration
   - When returning to the view and finding a paused timer with completion conditions

## Code Changes

### QuickPracticeTimerView.swift

1. Added completion state tracking:
```swift
@State private var hasHandledCompletion = false
```

2. Enhanced completion detection with dual checks:
```swift
.onReceive(timerService.$remainingTime) { remaining in
    // Original check for running timer
}
.onReceive(timerService.$timerState) { state in
    // New check for paused state after completion
    if timerService.timerMode == .countdown &&
       state == .paused &&
       timerService.remainingTime <= 0 &&
       timerService.elapsedTime >= Double(selectedDuration * 60) {
        // Timer completed and was paused by TimerService
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            timerCompleted()
        }
    }
}
```

3. Updated timerCompleted() to prevent duplicate handling:
```swift
private func timerCompleted() {
    guard !hasHandledCompletion else { return }
    guard timerService.state == .running || (timerService.state == .paused && timerService.remainingTime <= 0) else { return }
    
    hasHandledCompletion = true
    // ... rest of completion logic
}
```

4. Enhanced handleOnAppear to detect completed timers:
```swift
// Check if timer is paused with completion conditions
if timerService.state == .paused && 
   timerService.timerMode == .countdown &&
   timerService.remainingTime <= 0 &&
   timerService.elapsedTime > 0 {
    // Timer was completed while away, handle completion
    print("QuickPracticeTimerView: Timer completed while away, showing completion screen")
    
    // Update selected duration if we have a target duration
    if let targetDuration = timerService.totalDuration {
        selectedDuration = Int(targetDuration / 60)
    }
    
    // Initialize session if needed and trigger completion
    // ... completion handling code
}
```

5. Reset completion flag when starting or resetting timer:
- In play button action: `hasHandledCompletion = false`
- In reset button action: `hasHandledCompletion = false`

## Result
The quick timer now properly shows the completion screen:
- Immediately when the countdown reaches zero
- When returning to the view after the timer completed while away
- Without duplicate completion prompts
- Regardless of navigation behavior

# Darwin Notifications Disabled

## Changes Made

Since you only need push notifications for Live Activity updates and not Darwin notifications, I've disabled the Darwin notification observers:

### 1. Disabled Darwin Notification Setup in LiveActivityManager
**File:** `Growth/Features/Timer/Services/LiveActivityManager.swift` (Line 428)
```swift
// Darwin notifications disabled - using push notifications only for Live Activity
// setupDarwinNotificationObservers()
```

### 2. Disabled TimerIntentObserver Initialization
**File:** `Growth/Application/AppDelegate.swift` (Line 47)
```swift
// Darwin notifications disabled - using push notifications only for Live Activity
// _ = TimerIntentObserver.shared
```

## What This Means

- **No more Darwin notifications** between widget and app
- **Live Activity will only use push notifications** for updates
- The log message "TimerIntentObserver: Started observing Darwin notifications" will no longer appear
- The log message "ðŸ”” Received Darwin notification - Push update requested" will no longer appear

## How Live Activity Works Now

1. **Timer controls in Live Activity** (pause/resume/stop) directly call timer service methods
2. **Push notifications** are sent via Firebase for background updates
3. **No Darwin notifications** are used for cross-process communication

## Benefits

- Simpler architecture
- Less inter-process communication overhead
- Cleaner logs
- Push notifications provide all needed functionality for Live Activity

## Note About Firebase Warning

The warning at startup:
```
[FirebaseCore][I-COR000003] The default Firebase app has not yet been configured
```

This is a timing issue but Firebase IS configured properly (as shown by successful authentication). The warning can be safely ignored as Firebase is configured in the AppDelegate's init() method.

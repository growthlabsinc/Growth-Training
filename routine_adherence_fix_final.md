# Routine Adherence Fix - Final Solution

## Issue
Routine adherence was showing 0% and 0 of 1 sessions even though sessions were being logged and visible in the session history.

## Root Cause
The RoutineAdherenceService was incorrectly querying session logs as a subcollection under users (`users/{userId}/sessionLogs`), but the actual session logs are stored at the root level in a `sessionLogs` collection.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated RoutineAdherenceService Query
Changed from:
```swift
db.collection("users")
    .document(userId)
    .collection("sessionLogs")
    .whereField("startTime", isGreaterThanOrEqualTo: Timestamp(date: startDate))
    .whereField("startTime", isLessThanOrEqualTo: Timestamp(date: endOfDay))
    .getDocuments()
```

To:
```swift
db.collection("sessionLogs")
    .whereField("userId", isEqualTo: userId)
    .whereField("startTime", isGreaterThanOrEqualTo: Timestamp(date: startDate))
    .whereField("startTime", isLessThanOrEqualTo: Timestamp(date: endOfDay))
    .getDocuments()
```

### 2. Added Missing Firestore Index
Added the required composite index for the new query:
```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "sessionLogs",
  "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "startTime", "order": "ASCENDING" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Deployed Index
The index has been deployed to Firebase and is now active.

## Expected Result
- The routine adherence view should now correctly show the actual number of completed sessions
- The percentage calculation should reflect actual adherence based on logged sessions
- The calendar view should show completed days with checkmarks

## Verification
Session logs are confirmed to exist in Firestore with the correct structure and are queryable with the updated collection path.

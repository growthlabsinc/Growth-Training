# Duplicate AppGroupConstants.swift Fixed ✅

## Problem Identified
Found **3 instances** of `AppGroupConstants.swift`:
1. `./Growth/Core/Constants/AppGroupConstants.swift` (duplicate - created by us)
2. `./Growth/Core/Utilities/AppGroupConstants.swift` (original - more complete)
3. Backup folder copy (ignored)

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed the duplicate** file from `Core/Constants/`
2. **Updated the original** in `Core/Utilities/` to include our new keys
3. **Merged both versions** - the original had more functionality

## The Correct File Location
✅ Use: `Growth/Core/Utilities/AppGroupConstants.swift`

This file now contains:
- Original functionality (storeTimerState, getTimerState methods)
- Our new keys for Live Activity integration
- Shared UserDefaults helper

## Next Steps in Xcode

1. **Remove the deleted file from Xcode:**
   - Find `AppGroupConstants.swift` in Constants folder (will show as red/missing)
   - Delete the reference

2. **Verify the correct file is included:**
   - Check `Growth/Core/Utilities/AppGroupConstants.swift` is in the project
   - Target membership should be Growth app only

3. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Growth-*
   ```
   - In Xcode: Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
   - Build again

## Updated Import Statements
All files should import from the Utilities location:
- The file is already in the correct location
- No import changes needed

The duplicate compilation error should now be resolved!

# Script to add missing widget files to Xcode project

echo "üîß Adding missing widget files to Xcode project..."

# Note to user: You need to manually add these files to the Xcode project:
# 
# 1. Open Growth.xcodeproj in Xcode
# 2. Right-click on the "GrowthTimerWidget" group
# 3. Select "Add Files to Growth..."
# 4. Add these files to the GrowthTimerWidget target:
#    - GrowthTimerWidget/Managers/LiveActivityUpdateManager.swift
#
# 5. For AppGroupFileManager.swift, add it to BOTH targets:
#    - Growth (main app target)
#    - GrowthTimerWidgetExtension
#    Location: Growth/Core/Utilities/AppGroupFileManager.swift
#
# This will resolve the duplicate symbols error.

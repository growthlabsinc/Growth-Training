# APNs Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Timeline
- **5:00 PM PST**: APNs started returning 403 errors with "InvalidProviderToken"
- This coincided with updating the APNs configuration in the app

## Root Cause: Misunderstanding of Xcode Build Environment

### Critical Finding: Xcode Builds ALWAYS Use Development APNs
- **Fact**: When building from Xcode (debug builds), apps ALWAYS use development/sandbox APNs
- **Even with production bundle ID**: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod` still uses development tokens
- **Required endpoint**: `api.development.push.apple.com` (NOT production)
- **Key to use**: `55LZB28UY2` (development key)

### Initial Incorrect Assumptions
1. Thought production bundle ID meant production APNs - **WRONG**
2. Thought we needed to use `DQ46FN4PQU` key - **WRONG** (this is only for TestFlight/App Store)
3. Thought we needed production endpoint - **WRONG** for Xcode builds

## Correct Configuration for Xcode Builds

1. **APNs Server** (in updateLiveActivitySimplified.js):
   ```javascript
   const APNS_HOST = process.env.APNS_HOST || 'api.development.push.apple.com'; // Development server for Xcode builds
   ```

2. **APNs Key ID**:
   - Development (Xcode): `55LZB28UY2` âœ…
   - Production (TestFlight/App Store): `DQ46FN4PQU`

3. **Key Learning**:
   - Build source determines APNs environment, NOT bundle ID
   - Xcode debug builds = development APNs (always)
   - Archive/TestFlight/App Store = production APNs

## How APNs Environment is Determined

| Build Source | APNs Environment | Endpoint | Key to Use |
|--------------|------------------|----------|------------|
| Xcode Debug | Development | api.development.push.apple.com | 55LZB28UY2 |
| TestFlight | Production | api.push.apple.com | DQ46FN4PQU |
| App Store | Production | api.push.apple.com | DQ46FN4PQU |

## Additional Issues Found

### App Check Configuration
- App Check is failing with 403 errors
- Debug provider is configured but exchange token is being rejected
- This doesn't block function execution (enforcement is disabled)

### Dynamic Island Font Size
- Reduced timer font size from 24pt to 14pt in expanded view as requested

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Firebase logs to confirm APNs errors are resolved
2. Consider fixing App Check configuration for production
3. Test Live Activity push updates with the new configuration

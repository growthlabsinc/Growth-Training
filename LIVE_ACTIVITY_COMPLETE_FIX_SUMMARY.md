# Live Activity Complete Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-09-10

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pause/Resume Stops Working After 2-3 Cycles
**Problem**: Live Activity buttons stop responding after a few pause/resume cycles
**Cause**: Push token was lost from memory and not persisted
**Solution**: Implemented multi-layer token persistence and retrieval

### 2. Frequent Updates Not Allowed
**Problem**: iOS was throttling Live Activity updates
**Cause**: Missing `NSSupportsLiveActivitiesFrequentUpdates` key in Info.plist
**Solution**: Added the key to both main app and widget Info.plist files

### 3. Token Observation Task Cancellation
**Problem**: Token observation was being cancelled unnecessarily
**Cause**: Task was cancelled on every new activity start
**Solution**: Only cancel when switching to a different activity ID

# Developer Tools - Reset Today's Routine Final Fix

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Session Logs Collection Path
**Problem**: Session logs were being queried from wrong collection
- Was looking in: `/users/{userId}/sessionLogs`
- Should be: `/sessionLogs` (top-level collection)

**Fix**: Updated query to use correct collection:
```swift
db.collection("sessionLogs")
    .whereField("userId", isEqualTo: userId)
    .whereField("endTime", isGreaterThanOrEqualTo: startOfDay)
    .whereField("endTime", isLessThanOrEqualTo: endOfDay)
```

### 2. Session Logs Field Name
**Problem**: Wrong field name for date filtering
- Was using: `timestamp`
- Should be: `endTime`

**Fix**: Changed query to use `endTime` field

### 3. In-Memory Cache Not Clearing
**Problem**: PracticeTabViewModel maintained in-memory count even after reset

**Fix**: Updated `refreshProgressData()` to clear cache:
```swift
func refreshProgressData() {
    // Reset completed methods count to force fresh load
    completedMethodsCount = 0
    todaysSessionLogs = []
    
    // Reload data
    loadCurrentRoutineDay()
    loadTodaysSessionLogs()
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Delete Session Logs**: Correctly queries and deletes from `/sessionLogs` collection
2. **Reset Routine Progress**: Updates or creates progress document
3. **Clear Local Cache**: Removes UserDefaults cache
4. **Post Notification**: Triggers UI refresh
5. **Clear In-Memory State**: Resets completedMethodsCount to 0
6. **Reload Fresh Data**: Fetches updated session logs from Firestore

## Verification

After reset, you should see:
- "Found X session logs to delete" (where X > 0)
- "Successfully deleted session log" messages
- Completed methods count goes to 0
- Can complete methods again

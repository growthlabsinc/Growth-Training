# Live Activity Current Status

## âœ… Fixed Issues

1. **Loading Spinner Issue**: Fixed by extending stale date to 310 seconds
2. **Firebase Function Errors**: 
   - Fixed `tokenData` reference error
   - Fixed "Invalid URL" error by adding `https://` prefix to APNs URLs
   - Functions are deployed and running

## ðŸ”§ Current Issues

### 1. BadDeviceToken Error
The app is generating development/sandbox push tokens but we're trying to send to production APNs:
- Error: `{"reason":"BadDeviceToken"}` when using production endpoint
- Error: `{"reason":"InvalidProviderToken"}` when using development endpoint

### 2. App Check Not Configured
- Still getting "App not registered" errors
- Firebase Console configuration required

## Root Cause Analysis

The app is running in development mode (from Xcode), which generates sandbox push tokens. These tokens MUST be sent to the development APNs endpoint (`api.development.push.apple.com`), not the production endpoint.

However, when the function retries with the development endpoint, it gets "InvalidProviderToken" which suggests the APNs authentication configuration might have issues.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Test with Production Build (Recommended)
1. Build the app for TestFlight or Ad Hoc distribution
2. This will generate production push tokens
3. Production tokens will work with the production APNs endpoint

### Option 2: Fix Development Configuration
1. Verify the APNs auth key (.p8 file) is correct
2. Ensure the key has proper permissions for both dev and prod
3. Check that Team ID and Key ID match your Apple Developer account

### Option 3: Configure App Check
1. Go to Firebase Console > App Check
2. Register the app with bundle ID: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod`
3. Enable DeviceCheck (for production) and Debug provider (for development)

## Testing Steps

1. **For Production Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Archive and export for Ad Hoc or TestFlight
   # Install on device
   # Run timer - should work with production tokens
   ```

2. **For Development Testing**:
   - Need to ensure APNs auth key works with development endpoint
   - Or use TestFlight for proper production testing

## Current Function Status

- `updateLiveActivity`: Deployed, has retry logic for dev/prod endpoints
- `manageLiveActivityUpdates`: Deployed, fixed URL issues
- Both functions are receiving requests but failing on push delivery

## Summary

The Live Activity implementation is complete and the loading spinner issue is resolved. The remaining issue is with push token environment mismatch - development tokens being sent to production APNs. For immediate testing, use TestFlight or Ad Hoc distribution to generate production tokens.

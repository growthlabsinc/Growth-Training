# Final Compilation Errors Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Removed All Duplicate Type Definitions from AICoachService.swift
**Problem**: Duplicate definitions causing ambiguity errors
- FeatureAccess was defined both in AICoachService.swift and FeatureAccess.swift
- Other temporary types were conflicting with real implementations

**Solution**: 
- Removed ALL temporary stub types from AICoachService.swift
- Added comments indicating where the real types are defined
- Fixed the call to use `.aiCoach` instead of `"ai_coach"`

### 2. ✅ Types Not Found in Scope
**Problem**: FeatureType and PaywallContext not found in FunnelEvent.swift
**Cause**: These types are defined in other files in the same module
**Solution**: The types should be accessible once all files are in the same build target

## Changes Made

### AICoachService.swift
```swift
// BEFORE: Had duplicate definitions
enum FeatureAccess { ... }
struct ChatMessage { ... }
// etc.

// AFTER: No duplicates, just comments
// Note: Types are defined in:
// - FeatureAccess: Growth/Core/Models/FeatureAccess.swift
// - FeatureType: Growth/Core/Models/SubscriptionTier.swift
// etc.
```

### Fixed Method Call
```swift
// BEFORE:
FeatureAccess.from(feature: "ai_coach")

// AFTER:
FeatureAccess.from(feature: .aiCoach)
```

## To Complete the Fix in Xcode

Ensure all these files are included in the same build target:
1. `Growth/Core/Models/FeatureAccess.swift`
2. `Growth/Core/Models/SubscriptionTier.swift` (contains FeatureType)
3. `Growth/Core/Models/PaywallContext.swift`
4. `Growth/Features/AICoach/Models/ChatMessage.swift`
5. `Growth/Features/AICoach/Services/PromptTemplateService.swift`
6. `Growth/Core/Models/Analytics/FunnelEvent.swift`
7. `Growth/Features/AICoach/Services/AICoachService.swift`

## Result
- No more duplicate type definitions
- No more ambiguity errors
- Proper type references throughout
- Code should compile once all files are in the same target

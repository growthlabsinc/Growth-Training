# Live Activity Firebase Synchronization Fix

## Issue
The Live Activity pause button wasn't updating the UI due to "GTMSessionFetcher was already running" errors. Multiple concurrent Firebase function calls were blocking each other.

## Root Cause Analysis
From the Xcode logs (timestamp 17:58:21):
1. Timer pause action executed correctly at the app level
2. Live Activity local update completed
3. Firebase function call failed with: "GTMSessionFetcher was already running"
4. This prevented the push notification update from being sent to the Live Activity

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added FirebaseSynchronizer Actor
Created a thread-safe synchronization mechanism to prevent concurrent Firebase calls:
```swift
@available(iOS 13.0, *)
private actor FirebaseSynchronizer {
    private var isUpdating = false
    
    func beginUpdate(for action: String) -> Bool {
        guard !isUpdating else { return false }
        isUpdating = true
        return true
    }
    
    func endUpdate() {
        isUpdating = false
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated All Timer Control Methods
Added synchronization checks to prevent concurrent updates:

#### pauseTimer()
- Check if another update is in progress before proceeding
- Store pause state in App Group immediately for race condition prevention
- Update Live Activity locally first (critical for iOS 16/17 compatibility)
- Store state in Firestore
- Send push update via Firebase Function

#### resumeTimer()
- Added same synchronization pattern
- Clear pause state from App Group
- Calculate pause duration and adjust start time
- Update locally before Firebase call

#### stopTimer() and completeTimer()
- Added synchronization to prevent conflicts
- Ensure clean shutdown of Live Activities

### 3. Fixed Method References
- Changed `callFirebaseFunction()` to use existing `sendPushUpdate()` method
- Ensured consistent error handling across all methods

## Key Benefits
1. **Prevents Concurrent Firebase Calls**: Only one Firebase operation at a time
2. **Immediate Local Updates**: Users see changes instantly on iOS 17+
3. **Race Condition Prevention**: App Group state stored immediately
4. **Better Error Handling**: Clear logging when updates are skipped

## Testing Steps
1. Build and run on physical device (iOS 16.2+)
2. Start a timer and observe Live Activity
3. Lock the device
4. Tap pause button on Live Activity
5. Timer should pause immediately without "GTMSessionFetcher" errors
6. Unlock device and verify timer state is correctly synced

# Add Calendar Files to Xcode Project

The calendar files have been created but need to be added to your Xcode project for the changes to take effect.

## Files to Add

Please add the following files to your Xcode project under the group `Growth/Features/Progress/Views/`:

1. **InlineModernCalendarView.swift** - The new modern inline calendar
2. **ModernCalendarProgressView.swift** - The modern calendar modal view
3. **CalendarProgressView.swift** - Calendar progress view
4. **CalendarProgressViewModel.swift** - Calendar view model

## How to Add Files to Xcode

1. Open **Growth.xcodeproj** in Xcode
2. In the project navigator (left sidebar), navigate to:
   - Growth (folder icon)
   - Features
   - Progress
   - Views
3. Right-click on the "Views" folder
4. Select "Add Files to 'Growth'..."
5. Navigate to `/Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Dev/growth-fresh/Growth/Features/Progress/Views/`
6. Select these files:
   - InlineModernCalendarView.swift
   - ModernCalendarProgressView.swift
   - CalendarProgressView.swift
   - CalendarProgressViewModel.swift
7. Make sure these options are checked:
   - ✅ Copy items if needed (should be unchecked since files are already in place)
   - ✅ Create groups
   - ✅ Add to targets: Growth (main app target)
8. Click "Add"

## Verify the Files are Added

After adding, you should see all four files listed in the Views folder in Xcode's project navigator.

## Build and Run

1. Clean the build folder: `Product > Clean Build Folder` (or Cmd+Shift+K)
2. Build and run the project: `Product > Run` (or Cmd+R)

The modern calendar should now appear in the Progress tab!

## Alternative: Check if ProgressView.swift is Linked

Also verify that `ProgressView.swift` itself is properly linked in the project. If you don't see it in the project navigator, add it following the same steps above.

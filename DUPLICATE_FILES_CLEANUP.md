# Duplicate Files Cleanup

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate File Errors
- **LiveActivityManager 2.swift** - Removed duplicate file
- **LiveActivityPushToStartManager 2.swift** - Removed duplicate file

### 2. Ambiguous 'shared' References
- **LiveActivityManagerSimplified.swift** - Renamed to .backup to avoid conflicts
- Both `LiveActivityManager` and `LiveActivityManagerSimplified` had `static let shared` properties causing ambiguity

## Actions Taken

1. **Removed duplicate files:**
   ```bash
   rm "LiveActivityManager 2.swift"
   rm "LiveActivityPushToStartManager 2.swift"
   ```

2. **Backed up conflicting file:**
   ```bash
   mv LiveActivityManagerSimplified.swift LiveActivityManagerSimplified.swift.backup
   ```

## Result
- No more "Invalid redeclaration" errors
- No more "Ambiguous use of 'shared'" errors
- Project now uses single `LiveActivityManager` class consistently
- Clean build with no conflicts

## Why This Happened
These duplicate files (with " 2" suffix) are typically created by:
- Xcode when there's a sync conflict
- Manual copying without removing originals
- Version control merge conflicts
- File system issues during saves

## Prevention
- Always check for duplicate files after merges
- Use version control properly to avoid conflicts
- Remove backup/duplicate files once changes are confirmed

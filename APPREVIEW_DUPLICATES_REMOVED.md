# AppReviewSubscriptionHandler - Duplicates Removed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Duplicate Type Definitions
**Problem**: Types like SubscriptionState, SubscriptionTier were already defined elsewhere
**Solution**: Removed all duplicate type definitions

### 2. ✅ Simplified validateWithSandbox Return Type
**Problem**: ValidationResult type was ambiguous
**Solution**: Changed return type from `ValidationResult` to `Bool`

```swift
// BEFORE:
private func validateWithSandbox(_:) async throws -> ValidationResult

// AFTER:
private func validateWithSandbox(_:) async throws -> Bool
```

### 3. ✅ Replaced SubscriptionProductIDs Reference
**Problem**: SubscriptionProductIDs was a duplicate definition
**Solution**: Used inline array of product IDs instead

```swift
// BEFORE:
for productId in SubscriptionProductIDs.allProductIDs

// AFTER:
let productIds = [
    "com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.weekly",
    "com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.quarterly",
    "com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.premium.yearly"
]
for productId in productIds
```

## Result
- No more duplicate type definitions
- No more ambiguous type references
- File uses existing types from the project
- Simplified validation to return Bool instead of complex types

## Note
The types that were causing conflicts (SubscriptionState, SubscriptionTier, etc.) are already defined elsewhere in the project. This handler now uses those existing definitions instead of creating duplicates.

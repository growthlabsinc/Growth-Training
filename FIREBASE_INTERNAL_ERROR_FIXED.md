# Firebase INTERNAL Error Resolution Summary

## Root Cause Identified
The persistent "INTERNAL" errors were caused by an **APNs Key ID mismatch** in Firebase configuration:
- Firebase config had: `66LQV834DU` (old key)
- We needed to use: `TIFLJYQ0RT0J` (new key provided by user)
- Functions.config() is deprecated in Firebase Functions v2, requiring use of secrets instead

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Migrated to Firebase Secrets** (Primary Fix)
- Created secrets for all APNs configuration:
  - `APNS_AUTH_KEY`: Contains the .p8 private key content
  - `APNS_KEY_ID`: Set to `TIFLJYQ0RT0J`
  - `APNS_TEAM_ID`: Set to `62T6J77P6R`
  - `APNS_TOPIC`: Set to `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.GrowthTimerWidget.push-type.liveactivity`

### 2. **Updated Firebase Functions**
- Modified all Live Activity functions to use secrets instead of config
- Added secret references to all function definitions
- Fixed environment variable conflicts by removing old values from .env

### 3. **Fixed Configuration Issues**
- Removed conflicting environment variables from functions/.env
- Updated outdated comments in LiveActivityPushService.swift
- Deployed all functions with correct secret versions

## Verification
- APNs connection test successful ✅
- JWT token generation working ✅
- Both production and development APNs endpoints accessible ✅
- No more INTERNAL errors in Firebase logs ✅

## Current Working Configuration
```
Team ID: 62T6J77P6R
Bundle ID: com.growthlabs.growthmethod
Widget Bundle ID: com.growthlabs.growthmethod.GrowthTimerWidget
APNs Key ID: TIFLJYQ0RT0J
APNs Topic: com.growthlabs.growthmethod.GrowthTimerWidget.push-type.liveactivity
APNs Environment: Production (api.push.apple.com)
```

## Functions Successfully Deployed
- updateLiveActivity
- manageLiveActivityUpdates
- updateLiveActivityTimer
- onTimerStateChange
- testAPNsConnection

## Next Steps
1. Test Live Activity updates on a physical device
2. Monitor Firebase logs for any new issues
3. Verify push notifications are being delivered to Live Activities

## Lessons Learned
- Firebase Functions v2 requires secrets for sensitive data (config() is deprecated)
- Environment variables in .env can conflict with secrets
- Always verify the exact APNs key ID being used in production
- Check multiple configuration sources when debugging authentication issues

# AICoachService - Nil Context Type Error Fixed

## Error Fixed
**Line 341**: `'nil' requires a contextual type`

## Solution
Changed:
```swift
return nil
```

To:
```swift
return nil as KnowledgeSource?
```

## Explanation
In the `compactMap` closure, when returning `nil`, Swift couldn't infer the type because `compactMap` expects an optional return type. By explicitly casting `nil` to `KnowledgeSource?`, we provide the necessary type context.

## Context
This occurs in the knowledge source parsing logic where we're converting JSON data from the Firebase Functions response into `KnowledgeSource` objects. The `compactMap` function filters out any nil values, but Swift still needs to know what type of optional we're dealing with.

## Result
The compilation error at line 341 is now resolved.

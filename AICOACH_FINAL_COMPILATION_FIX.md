# AICoachService - Final Compilation Fix

## All Remaining Errors Resolved

### 1. ✅ OSLogMessage Conversion Error Fixed
**Line 274**: Changed `logger.log(level: .info, jsonString)` to `logger.log(level: .info, "\(jsonString)")`
- OSLogMessage requires string interpolation syntax

### 2. ✅ Missing Types Added
Added minimal type definitions for compilation:
- `ChatMessage` - Basic message structure for AI conversations
- `KnowledgeSource` - Knowledge reference type for AI responses
- `FeatureAccess` - Feature access control enum
- `FeatureType` - Feature identifier enum
- `PromptTemplateService` - Prompt template service class

These are wrapped in `#if true` directive and can be disabled once proper imports are available.

## Important Note
The temporary type definitions are minimal implementations to allow compilation. The actual implementations exist in:
- `Growth/Features/AICoach/Models/ChatMessage.swift`
- `Growth/Core/Models/FeatureAccess.swift`
- `Growth/Core/Models/SubscriptionTier.swift` (contains FeatureType)
- `Growth/Features/AICoach/Services/PromptTemplateService.swift`

## To Fix Properly in Xcode
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the AICoachService.swift file
3. In the File Inspector, ensure it's part of the main app target
4. Select the model files listed above
5. Ensure they're also part of the same target
6. Change `#if true` to `#if false` in AICoachService.swift
7. Clean and rebuild

## Result
All compilation errors in AICoachService.swift are now resolved:
- ✅ Logger properly configured
- ✅ OSLogMessage conversion fixed
- ✅ All required types defined
- ✅ Ready for successful compilation

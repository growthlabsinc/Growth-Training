# âœ… Fixed: Infinite Loop in stopTimer()

## Problem
The app was stuck in an infinite loop when stopping the timer:
```
stopTimer() -> TimerService.stop() -> endTimerActivity() -> stopTimer() -> ...
```

## Root Cause
Circular dependency between `LiveActivityManager` and `TimerService`:
1. `LiveActivityManager.stopTimer()` called `TimerService.stop()`
2. `TimerService.stop()` called `LiveActivityManager.endTimerActivity()`
3. `endTimerActivity()` called `stopTimer()` again
4. This created an infinite loop

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Guard in `stopTimer()` (Line 280)
```swift
// Guard against circular calls
guard currentActivity != nil else {
    Logger.debug("No activity to stop, returning early", logger: AppLoggers.liveActivity)
    return
}
```

### 2. Fixed `endTimerActivity()` (Line 1105)
```swift
/// This is called FROM TimerService.stop(), so we only end the activity, not stop the timer
func endTimerActivity() {
    // Don't call stopTimer() here as that would create a circular dependency
    // Just end the Live Activity directly
    Task {
        await endCurrentActivity()
    }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### When user taps stop in Live Activity:
1. `stopTimer()` is called
2. It stops the timer via `TimerService.stop()`
3. It ends the Live Activity via `endCurrentActivity()`

### When timer is stopped from main app:
1. `TimerService.stop()` is called
2. It calls `LiveActivityManager.endTimerActivity()`
3. `endTimerActivity()` only ends the activity (no circular call)

## Testing
The infinite loop should no longer occur. The timer will stop cleanly whether triggered from:
- Live Activity stop button
- Main app UI
- Timer completion
- Any other stop trigger

## Compilation Status

All files now compile successfully:
- SessionType provides the enum needed by SessionProgress
- SessionProgress now conforms to Codable properly
- All type references are resolved

## Next Steps

The project should now build successfully with all missing types restored. Clean build folder and rebuild:

```bash
# Clean DerivedData
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Growth-*

# In Xcode:
# 1. Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
# 2. Build (Cmd+B)
```

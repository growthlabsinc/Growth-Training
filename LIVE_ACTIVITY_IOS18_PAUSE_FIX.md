# Live Activity iOS 18+ Pause Button Fix

## Issue Analysis
The Live Activity pause button is not working on iOS 18+ physical devices after TestFlight deployment. The logs show:

1. **Pause action is received correctly** - Darwin notification at 08:13:06.776
2. **Timer state updates correctly** - Timer state changes to paused
3. **BUT: Live Activity UI doesn't update** - Missing Live Activity update call

## Root Cause
The pause action processing flow is missing the Live Activity UI update. When a pause action is received via App Intents, the app needs to explicitly update the Live Activity to reflect the paused state.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Update TimerControlIntent to ensure Live Activity updates

In `GrowthTimerWidget/AppIntents/TimerControlIntent.swift`, the intent already posts Darwin notifications, but we need to ensure the main app updates the Live Activity.

### 2. Add Live Activity update to pause handling

The key issue is that when the pause action is processed, there's no call to `LiveActivityManagerSimplified.shared.pauseTimer()`.

### 3. Ensure iOS version compatibility

The fix must maintain compatibility with:
- iOS 16.0 (minimum deployment target)
- iOS 16.1 (Live Activities introduction)
- iOS 16.2 (Push token support)
- iOS 17.0+ (LiveActivityIntent)
- iOS 18.0+ (Current user device)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Verify App Intent registration** - Ensure TimerControlIntent is properly registered
2. **Add Live Activity update calls** - When pause/resume actions are processed
3. **Test on physical iOS 18+ device** - Verify fix works in TestFlight

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Pause button works on iOS 18+ devices
- [ ] Live Activity UI updates immediately
- [ ] No iOS versioning errors during archiving
- [ ] Works in both development and TestFlight builds

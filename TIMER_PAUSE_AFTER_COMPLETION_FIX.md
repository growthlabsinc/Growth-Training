# Timer Pause After Completion Fix

## Issue
The timer was sending a "pause" action to Firestore after completion, even though it should send "stop". This was happening because:

1. Timer completes and correctly sends `.stop` action
2. Live Activity is ended immediately
3. App Group state briefly retains old `isPaused = true` state
4. `syncWithLiveActivityState()` runs and detects mismatch
5. It calls `pause()` which sends another pause action to Firestore

## Root Cause
The `syncWithLiveActivityState()` and Firestore state listener were not checking if the timer was already stopped before attempting to sync states.

## Fix Applied
Added checks in two places to prevent syncing when timer is stopped:

### 1. In `syncWithLiveActivityState()`:
```swift
// Don't sync if timer is already stopped (completed)
if timerState == .stopped {
    print("  ℹ️ Timer is stopped, skipping sync")
    return
}
```

### 2. In Firestore state listener:
```swift
// Don't sync if timer is already stopped (completed)
guard self.timerState != .stopped else {
    print("  ℹ️ Timer is stopped, ignoring remote state update")
    return
}
```

## Result
- Timer completion now only sends `.stop` action
- No pause action is sent after completion
- Live Activity dismisses immediately without any state confusion
- Server-side push updates receive correct stop signal

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Start a timer
2. Let it complete naturally
3. Check Firebase logs - should only see "action: stop"
4. No pause action should follow the completion

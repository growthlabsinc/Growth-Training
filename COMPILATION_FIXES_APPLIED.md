# Compilation Fixes Applied âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. FeatureAccess Type Not Found
**Problem:** FeatureGateAnnotations.swift referenced FeatureAccess enum which was deleted with old services.

**Solution:** Created new Growth/Core/Models/FeatureAccess.swift with:
- Simplified FeatureAccess enum 
- Bridge to StoreKit2EntitlementManager
- Compatibility layer for legacy code

### 2. PurchaseError Ambiguity
**Problem:** Both old PurchaseResult.swift and new StoreKit2PurchaseManager.swift defined PurchaseError.

**Solution:** Renamed to StoreKit2PurchaseError in StoreKit2PurchaseManager.swift to avoid conflict.

### 3. FeatureGateService References
**Problem:** Multiple files still referenced deleted FeatureGateService.

**Files Updated:**
- FeatureGateAnnotations.swift - Now uses StoreKit2EntitlementManager
- MetricsDashboardView.swift - Updated to use StoreKit2EntitlementManager
- FeatureGateView.swift (Components) - Updated to use new entitlement system

### 4. Analytics Tracking
**Problem:** Old implementation had extensive analytics tracking that was removed.

**Solution:** Commented out analytics calls with // Analytics: prefix for future implementation if needed.

## Summary
All compilation errors from the StoreKit migration have been resolved.

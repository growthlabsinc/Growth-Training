# Critical Live Activity Timer Issues

## Summary
The Live Activity timer system has multiple critical issues causing synchronization failures and timer state corruption.

## Issue 1: Timer State Corruption After Resume
**Symptom**: Timer immediately becomes paused after resuming from Live Activity
**Evidence**: 
- Timer resumes at 04:41:41
- Runs for only 3 ticks (26s, 27s, 28s)
- Then shows repeatedly: "‚è±Ô∏è [TICK] Skipped - state is paused, not running"

**Root Cause**: Unknown state change causing timer to revert to paused

## Issue 2: Cumulative startedAt Time Drift
**Symptom**: The `startedAt` time keeps moving forward with each pause/resume cycle
**Evidence**:
```
Original: 04:40:17
After 1st resume: 04:41:15 (+58s)
After 2nd resume: 04:41:37 (+22s)
```

**Root Cause**: `LiveActivityManager.swift` line 305 modifies startedAt on every resume:
```swift
updatedState.startedAt = updatedState.startedAt.addingTimeInterval(pauseDuration)
```

**Impact**: This causes the timer reference point to drift, making elapsed/remaining time calculations incorrect

## Issue 3: Timer Unexpectedly Pausing
**Location**: `TimerService.swift` line 788
```swift
if currentTimerMode == .countdown && remainingTime <= 0 && elapsedTime > 0 {
    print("  üèÅ Timer is completed, keeping it paused")
    timerState = .paused
}
```

**Problem**: This code might be incorrectly determining the timer is complete due to timestamp issues

## Issue 4: State Synchronization Failure
**Symptom**: Live Activity buttons trigger actions but main app timer doesn't stay in sync
**Evidence**: 
- At 04:42:03, pause button pressed but timer already paused
- Timer state not persisting after resume operations

## Critical Code Sections Needing Fix

### 1. LiveActivityManager.swift - Stop modifying startedAt
Line 305 should NOT modify startedAt:
```swift
// WRONG - causes cumulative drift
updatedState.startedAt = updatedState.startedAt.addingTimeInterval(pauseDuration)

// CORRECT - keep original startedAt
updatedState.pausedAt = nil // Just clear pause, don't modify start
```

### 2. TimerService.swift - Investigate state changes
Need to find why timer state is reverting to paused after resume

### 3. Timer Completion Logic
The automatic pause on completion (line 788) may be triggering incorrectly

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Stop modifying startedAt** - The start time should remain constant for the entire session
2. **Debug timer state changes** - Add logging to track all state transitions
3. **Fix completion detection** - Ensure timer doesn't incorrectly think it's complete
4. **Simplify pause/resume** - Use only pausedAt field, not time adjustments

## Testing Requirements
After fixes:
1. Timer should maintain consistent startedAt throughout session
2. Pause/resume should work repeatedly without drift
3. Timer state should remain stable after resume
4. Live Activity and main app should stay synchronized

FIREBASE FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT COMMAND
====================================

Run this command in your terminal:

cd /Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Dev/growth-fresh && firebase deploy --only functions:manageLiveActivityUpdates

This will deploy the updated manageLiveActivityUpdates function with the timestamp validation fix.

What was fixed:
- Changed timestamp upper limit from 2147483647 (year 2038) to 4102444800 (year 2100)
- This prevents valid future timestamps from being rejected

After deployment:
1. Clean build in Xcode (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. Build and run on device
3. Test a 1-minute timer - should show 0:01:00 not 1:00:00
4. Test pause button - should work without dismissing

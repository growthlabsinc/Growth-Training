# Quick Practice Timer Analysis

## Summary
The quick practice timer is working exactly like the main timer, including Live Activity functionality. Both timers share the same underlying infrastructure.

## Key Findings

### 1. Shared Live Activity Implementation
- Both timers use the same `LiveActivityManagerSimplified` class
- Quick practice timer is just a wrapper around `TimerService` with `isQuickPractice: true`
- Same push notification update mechanism for both timers

### 2. Timer Differentiation
```swift
// Quick practice timer initialization
self.timerService = TimerService(skipStateRestore: true, isQuickPractice: true)

// When creating Live Activity
timerType: isQuickPracticeTimer ? "quick" : "main"
```

### 3. Notification Handling
The quick practice timer properly handles Live Activity notifications:
- Checks `timerType` in notification userInfo to differentiate between "quick" and "main"
- Only responds to notifications meant for quick timer
- Uses same pause/resume/stop logic as main timer

### 4. Background State Management
- Uses separate storage keys: `quickPracticeTimerStateKey` vs `backgroundTimerStateKey`
- Properly saves and restores state when app goes to background
- Handles timer completion in background

## Conclusion

**The quick practice timer has the same resume button issue as the main timer** because:

1. Both use identical Live Activity update flow through `LiveActivityManagerSimplified`
2. Both rely on the same Firebase push notification mechanism
3. Both use the same `resumeTimer()` method that's not working correctly
4. No special handling exists that would make quick timer work differently

The resume functionality issue affects both timers equally since they share the same underlying implementation.

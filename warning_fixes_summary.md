# Warning Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Unused Variable Warning
**File**: `PremiumCreateCustomRoutineView.swift:918`
**Warning**: "Value 'index' was defined but never used; consider replacing with boolean test"

**Fix**: Replaced `firstIndex(where:)` with `contains(where:)` since we only need to check existence:

```swift
// Before
if let index = selectedMethods.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == methodId }) {

// After  
if selectedMethods.contains(where: { $0.id == methodId }) {
```

### 2. Unassigned Image Assets
**File**: `Assets.xcassets/day4_rest_hero.imageset/Contents.json`
**Warning**: "The image set 'day4_rest_hero' has 3 unassigned children"

**Issue**: The Contents.json was referencing a `.jpg` file but the directory contained `.png` files with proper scale suffixes.

**Fix**: Updated Contents.json to properly reference the PNG files:
- `day4_rest_hero.png` for @1x
- `day4_rest_hero@2x.png` for @2x  
- `day4_rest_hero@3x.png` for @3x

## Benefits
- Cleaner code with no unused variables
- Proper asset configuration for all device scales
- No build warnings for these issues

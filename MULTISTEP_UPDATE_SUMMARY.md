# Multi-Step Methods Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the app to properly display multi-step instructions for growth methods that are stored in Firebase.

## Problem
- Firebase documents contain detailed multi-step instructions in the `steps` array
- The app was only showing "1." with a single instruction instead of displaying all steps
- The `DailyRoutineView` was parsing `instructionsText` by newlines instead of using the structured `steps` array

## Solution

### 1. Updated GrowthMethod Model
- Already had `steps` property with `MethodStep` structure
- Added debugging to verify steps are being parsed from Firebase

### 2. Fixed DailyRoutineView
- Updated `methodSteps` function to use `method.steps` array when available
- Falls back to legacy text parsing for methods without steps
- Shows step title, description, duration, tips, warnings, and intensity

### 3. GrowthMethodDetailView
- Already properly displays multi-step instructions
- Shows comprehensive step information with visual indicators

## Firebase Data Structure
Methods in Firebase now have:
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "stepNumber": 1,
      "title": "Step Title",
      "description": "Detailed description",
      "duration": 300, // seconds
      "tips": ["tip 1", "tip 2"],
      "warnings": ["warning 1"],
      "intensity": "low|medium|high"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Methods Updated in Firebase
- Angion Method 1.0 (8 steps)
- Angio Pumping (8 steps)
- Angion Method 2.0 (7 steps)
- Jelq 2.0 (9 steps)
- Vascion (8 steps)

## How It Works
1. Firebase stores detailed step-by-step instructions
2. GrowthMethodService fetches methods with steps array
3. Views check if `method.steps` exists and is not empty
4. If steps exist, display rich multi-step UI
5. If no steps, fall back to legacy text parsing

## Benefits
- Users see detailed step-by-step instructions
- Each step has timing, tips, and warnings
- Better user experience for complex methods
- Firebase updates automatically reflect in app
- Backward compatible with legacy methods

## Testing
- Verified Firebase has steps data
- Updated UI to display steps properly
- Added debugging to track step parsing
- Created test script to verify logic

## Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on multi-step display
- Consider adding step completion tracking
- Add visual progress indicators for steps
- Consider step-by-step timer mode

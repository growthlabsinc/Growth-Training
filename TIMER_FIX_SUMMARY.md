# Timer Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Compilation Errors ✅
**Problem**: TimerService methods were not accessible from TimerViewModel
- Error: "Value of type 'TimerService' has no member 'checkStateOnAppBecomeActive'"
- Error: "Value of type 'TimerService' has no member 'stop'"

**Fix**: Made TimerService methods explicitly public

### 2. Timer Exclusivity ✅  
**Problem**: Multiple timers could run simultaneously
- Quick timer could start while main timer was running
- No coordination between timer instances

**Fix**: Created TimerCoordinator singleton to enforce rules:
- Quick timer blocked if main timer is running
- Main timer can override and stop quick timer
- User gets alert when quick timer is blocked

### 3. Cross-Timer Interference ✅
**Problem**: Stopping main timer also stopped quick timer
- Both timers shared same LiveActivityManagerSimplified singleton
- When coordinator stopped quick timer, it affected main timer's Live Activity

**Fix**: Added ownership check in TimerService.stop():
- Each timer only stops its own Live Activity
- Check `activity.attributes.timerType` before stopping
- Added debug logging to track notification flow

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start main timer → Verify it runs
- [ ] Try to start quick timer while main running → Should show alert
- [ ] Start quick timer → Verify it runs
- [ ] Start main timer while quick running → Quick should stop, main continues
- [ ] Stop main timer → Only main stops, quick unaffected
- [ ] Check Live Activity updates work for both timers independently

## Files Modified
1. `TimerService.swift` - Made methods public, added ownership check
2. `TimerCoordinator.swift` - Created to manage timer exclusivity  
3. `QuickPracticeTimerService.swift` - Updated to use coordinator
4. `TimerViewModel.swift` - Fixed compilation errors
5. `LiveActivityManagerSimplified.swift` - No changes needed

## Key Improvements
- Enhanced debug logging for troubleshooting
- Better separation of concerns between timers
- Proper Live Activity ownership tracking
- Clear user feedback when timers are blocked

# AppReviewSubscriptionHandler Fixed

## Problem
- `SubscriptionServerValidator` was moved to OLD_STOREKIT_BACKUP during StoreKit 2 migration
- Multiple undefined types that were in deleted files
- Logger being used incorrectly

## Solution

### 1. ✅ Replaced SubscriptionServerValidator with StoreKit 2
```swift
// OLD: Using deleted SubscriptionServerValidator
return try await SubscriptionServerValidator.shared.validateReceipt(receiptData)

// NEW: Using StoreKit 2's built-in validation
for await result in Transaction.currentEntitlements {
    if case .verified(let transaction) = result {
        return true
    }
}
return false
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed Logger Usage
- Added logger instance: `private let logger = os.Logger(...)`
- Replaced all `Logger.` calls with `logger.`

### 3. ✅ Added Missing Types
Added temporary type definitions for compilation:
- `SubscriptionState` - Subscription state info
- `SubscriptionTier` - Tier enum (none, premium)
- `SubscriptionStatus` - Status enum (active, expired)
- `ValidationResult` - Validation result structure
- `ValidationSource` - Source enum (server, local)
- `SubscriptionProductIDs` - Product ID constants

## Result
- No more undefined type errors
- Using StoreKit 2's automatic validation instead of custom server validator
- File compiles successfully with StoreKit 2 approach

## Note
This handler is specifically for App Store review scenarios. With StoreKit 2, most of the custom validation logic is no longer needed as Apple handles validation automatically through Transaction.currentEntitlements.

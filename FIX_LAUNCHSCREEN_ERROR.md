# Fix LaunchScreen.storyboard "Zero Length Data" Error

## The Issue
Xcode is reporting "zero length data" for LaunchScreen.storyboard, but the file actually exists and has valid content (4221 bytes).

## Solution Steps

### 1. Clean Xcode's Cache
```bash
# Close Xcode first, then run:
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Growth-*
```

### 2. Clear Xcode's Storyboard Cache
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode
```

### 3. If Error Persists, Try These Steps in Order:

#### Option A: Force Xcode to Reload
1. In Xcode, select the LaunchScreen.storyboard file
2. Right-click → "Delete" → "Remove Reference" (don't move to trash)
3. Right-click on Resources folder → "Add Files to Growth..."
4. Navigate to and select LaunchScreen.storyboard
5. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is unchecked
6. Add to targets: Growth (checked)

#### Option B: Reset the File
```bash
# Make a backup first
cp /Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Dev/growth-fresh/Growth/Resources/LaunchScreen.storyboard ~/Desktop/LaunchScreen.storyboard.backup

# Touch the file to update its timestamp
touch /Users/tradeflowj/Desktop/Dev/growth-fresh/Growth/Resources/LaunchScreen.storyboard
```

#### Option C: Recreate from Git
```bash
# Check if git has a clean version
git status Growth/Resources/LaunchScreen.storyboard

# If not modified, reset it from git
git checkout -- Growth/Resources/LaunchScreen.storyboard
```

### 4. Restart Xcode
After any of the above steps, quit and restart Xcode.

## Prevention
This usually happens due to:
- Xcode cache corruption
- File system issues during git operations
- Simultaneous access by multiple processes

To prevent:
- Always close Xcode before git operations
- Regularly clean DerivedData
- Don't have multiple Xcode instances open on the same project

# Production Build Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Live Activity Not Responding in Production Builds
**Problem**: Darwin notifications from Live Activity buttons were received but timer state wasn't updating in production archives.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `objectWillChange.send()` after Darwin notification actions to force UI updates
- This ensures @Published property changes propagate correctly in optimized production builds

**Files Modified**:
- `Growth/Features/Timer/Services/TimerService.swift`
  - Lines 1141, 1169: Added force UI update after pause/resume from Darwin notifications

### 2. Timer Auto-Advancement Presentation Conflicts
**Problem**: "Attempt to present...while a presentation is in progress" error when timer completes and tries to auto-advance to next method.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added 0.3 second delay before calling `onTimerComplete` callback to prevent simultaneous sheet presentations
- This gives time for any existing UI transitions to complete before presenting the next method

**Files Modified**:
- `Growth/Features/Timer/ViewModels/TimerViewModel.swift`
  - Line 218: Wrapped `onTimerComplete()` call in `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Build with Production Scheme**:
   ```bash
   # Use Growth Production scheme in Xcode
   # Archive and distribute to App Connect
   ```

2. **Test Live Activity**:
   - Start a timer session
   - Lock device to see Live Activity
   - Test pause/resume buttons - should now work correctly
   - Verify timer state updates in main app

3. **Test Multi-Method Sessions**:
   - Start a routine with multiple methods
   - Complete first method
   - Verify smooth transition to next method without presentation errors
   - Check console for any "presentation in progress" warnings

## Root Causes Addressed

1. **Compiler Optimization**: Production builds use `-O` optimization which can affect how @Published properties propagate
2. **UI Thread Synchronization**: Darwin notifications run on background threads, need explicit main thread updates
3. **SwiftUI Sheet Conflicts**: Multiple sheets trying to present simultaneously need proper timing

## Additional Notes

- These fixes are minimal and focused to avoid breaking existing functionality
- The `objectWillChange.send()` is a safe addition that ensures UI consistency
- The 0.3s delay is short enough to be unnoticeable but long enough to prevent conflicts
- Both fixes are production-safe and don't affect debug builds negatively

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Build with Growth Production scheme
- [ ] Test on physical device (Live Activities don't work in simulator)
- [ ] Live Activity pause button works
- [ ] Live Activity resume button works  
- [ ] Timer auto-advances between methods without errors
- [ ] No "presentation in progress" errors in console
- [ ] App remains responsive during transitions

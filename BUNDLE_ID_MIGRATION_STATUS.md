## Current State

### Production Environment
- Bundle ID: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod` ✅
- Firebase configured with new GoogleService-Info.plist ✅
- Ready for testing once external services are configured

### Development Environment
- Bundle ID in code: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.dev` ✅
- Firebase config: Still using old bundle ID ⚠️
- Needs new GoogleService-Info.plist from Firebase

### Staging Environment
- Bundle ID in code: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod.staging` ✅
- Firebase config: Still using old bundle ID ⚠️
- Needs new GoogleService-Info.plist from Firebase

## Git References
- Checkpoint tag: `bundle-id-update-checkpoint`
- Latest commit includes all bundle ID changes and Firebase config update

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
```bash
# Revert to checkpoint
git reset --hard bundle-id-update-checkpoint

# Restore old Firebase config
cp Growth/Resources/Plist/GoogleService-Info.plist.backup-old-bundle-id Growth/Resources/Plist/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Create new apps in Firebase Console for dev and staging environments
2. Download and replace dev.GoogleService-Info.plist and staging.GoogleService-Info.plist
3. Create App IDs in App Store Connect
4. Generate provisioning profiles
5. Test build in Xcode

# Final Widget Fix

## Issue Fixed
- `validatedState` was referenced instead of `state` in GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivity.swift line 180

## Solution
Changed:
```swift
Text(validatedState.isPaused ? "Resume" : "Pause")
```

To:
```swift
Text(state.isPaused ? "Resume" : "Pause")
```

## Status
- All references to `validatedState` have been removed
- Widget uses consistent `state` variable throughout
- This was the last remaining reference to the old variable name

## Widget is now ready for testing with:
1. Simplified TimerActivityAttributes structure
2. Apple best practices (no direct Live Activity updates)
3. Proper time display (should show 0:01:00 not 1:00:00)
4. Pause/Resume/Stop functionality via Darwin notifications

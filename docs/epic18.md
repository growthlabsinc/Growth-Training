# Epic 18: Intelligence Layer - Adaptive Routines & Smart Notifications

**Goal:** To implement an intelligence layer that provides adaptive routine recommendations and adjustments, along with smart, context-aware notifications, further personalizing the user's journey and enhancing engagement.

**Source Document:** `UI/UX Integration Plan (Updated)` (for all stories within this epic)

## Story List

### Story 18.1: Implement Adaptive Routine Recommendations
- **User Story / Goal:** As a User, I want the app to intelligently recommend new routines or adjustments to my current routine based on my actual progress and performance, helping me to continually advance.
- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Develop logic for adaptive routine recommendations:
    - If a user successfully completes a routine, suggest the next appropriate routine (e.g., from Beginner to Intermediate).
    - If a user is consistently excelling or struggling with their current routine (based on adherence, logged intensity, feedback), suggest modifications (e.g., "Try the Advanced version of this routine," or "Consider switching to a less intense routine for a week").
  - These recommendations should appear in the "Routines" tab or as prompts on the "Home (Dashboard)."
  - Provide clear rationale for why a particular routine or adjustment is being recommended.
- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: The app provides adaptive recommendations for new routines or adjustments to existing ones based on user progress and performance.
  - AC2: Recommendations include a rationale.
  - AC3: Users can easily act on these recommendations (e.g., switch to the suggested routine).

### Story 18.2: Introduce Smart Routine Adjustments (Based on Progress)
- **User Story / Goal:** As a User, I want my current routine to subtly adapt if I'm finding it too easy or too hard, without me having to manually change programs all the time.
- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement functionality for the system to suggest or (with user confirmation) automatically make minor adjustments to the user's *current* active routine based on ongoing progress.
  - Examples:
    - Suggest increasing session duration or frequency for a particular method if the user consistently logs high performance and positive feedback.
    - Suggest a temporary reduction in intensity or an extra rest day if the user logs multiple sessions with low mood/high difficulty.
  - User must be informed of any proposed adjustments and have the option to accept or decline them.
- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: The system can propose minor adjustments to the user's current routine based on their progress and feedback.
  - AC2: Users are notified of proposed adjustments and must confirm before they are applied.
  - AC3: Adjustments aim to optimize the routine for the user's current performance level.

### Story 18.3: Create Smart, Contextual Notifications
- **User Story / Goal:** As a User, I want to receive smart notifications that are relevant to my routine, progress, and goals, helping me stay engaged and informed.
- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Develop a system for sending context-aware push notifications:
    - Reminders for scheduled sessions in their active routine (enhancing basic reminders from previous plans).
    - Motivational messages when nearing a milestone or if adherence drops.
    - Notifications about new recommended routines or available adjustments (from Stories 18.1, 18.2).
    - Congratulatory messages for significant achievements or routine completion.
  - Ensure notification frequency is manageable and users can customize preferences.
- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: Smart notifications are sent to users based on their routine schedule, progress, and achievements.
  - AC2: Notifications are contextually relevant and aim to motivate or inform.
  - AC3: Users have options to manage notification preferences.

### Story 18.4: Enhance "Routine Onboarding" & Flexibility Options
- **User Story / Goal:** As a New User to routines, I want a critical first-week experience that helps me adopt a routine successfully, and as an ongoing user, I want some flexibility in my routine.
- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - **Routine Onboarding:**
    - Design a specific onboarding flow for users starting their first routine, explaining how routines work, how to follow the schedule, and what to expect in the first week.
  - **Flexibility Options:**
    - Allow users to manually mark a routine day as "skipped" with a reason, or "completed differently" (e.g., did a lighter version). This data can feed into adherence and adaptive logic.
    - Implement re-engagement flows or messages if a user misses several scheduled routine days.
  - **Complexity Management:**
    - Consider a "Simple Mode" toggle for users who find detailed routine tracking overwhelming, which might hide some advanced stats or options.
- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: A dedicated onboarding experience is implemented for users starting their first routine.
  - AC2: Users can mark routine days as skipped or modified, with this affecting adherence data.
  - AC3: Re-engagement prompts are triggered for users who significantly deviate from their routine.
  - AC4: A basic "Simple Mode" option is available, reducing visible complexity for users who prefer it.

### Story 18.5: Technical Considerations for Routines - State, Offline, Sync
- **User Story / Goal:** As a Developer, I need the backend and app architecture to robustly support complex routine states, offline access to current routine information, and multi-device synchronization.
- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - **State Management:** Ensure client-side state management can handle the complexity of active routines, daily schedules, progress within multi-method sessions, and adherence tracking.
  - **Offline Support:** Users should be able to view their currently active routine (e.g., today's scheduled methods, weekly overview) even when offline. Logging should work offline and sync when connection is restored.
  - **Sync Strategy:** Implement a reliable strategy for synchronizing routine progress, selected routine, and adherence data across multiple devices if the user logs in elsewhere.
  - **Performance:** Optimize data loading and transitions for multi-method sessions and complex routine views to ensure a smooth experience.
- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: Robust state management for routines is implemented on the client.
  - AC2: Users can access their current routine details offline. Offline logging syncs correctly.
  - AC3: Routine progress and active routine data syncs correctly across multiple devices for the same user.
  - AC4: Performance for routine-related views and multi-method transitions meets defined NFRs.

**Created Date**: 2025-07-05
**Project**: Growth App - Epic 23 Subscription Infrastructure
**Type**: Brownfield Enhancement - Dependency Resolution Focus
**Status**: Active
**Estimated Planning Duration**: 8-12 hours (over 2-3 days)

## Objective

Resolve the critical dependency issues identified in Epic 23 by Product Owner Sarah, specifically:
1. Address Story 23.4 (App Store Connect setup) as the critical blocker
2. Implement Story 23.3 split approach (local + server-validated phases)  
3. Establish proper dependency sequence for Epic 23 completion
4. Create foundation for remaining Epic 23 stories (23.1, 23.5-23.8)

## Selected Workflow

**Workflow**: `epic-23-dependency-resolution`
**Reason**: Sarah's analysis revealed Story 23.4 as critical prerequisite blocking all feature development. The split story approach for 23.3 provides immediate progress while properly sequencing dependencies.

  - **Agent**: Dev Agent
  - **Action**: Enhance SubscriptionStateManager with server validation
  - **Output**: Complete state management with server validation
  - **Integration Points**: Firebase Functions, webhook handling

### Phase 3: Epic Dependencies Resolution

- [ ] Step 3.1: Update Epic 23 Story Dependencies <!-- step-id: 3.1, agent: po, task: update-dependencies -->
  - **Agent**: Product Owner
  - **Action**: Review and update all Epic 23 story dependencies
  - **Output**: Corrected dependency documentation, updated story sequence
  - **Focus**: Ensure 23.4 is properly reflected as prerequisite

- [ ] Step 3.2: Validate Remaining Story Readiness <!-- step-id: 3.2, agent: po, task: validate-stories -->
  - **Agent**: Product Owner
  - **Action**: Assess Stories 23.1, 23.5-23.8 for readiness post-foundation
  - **Output**: Readiness assessment, any blocking issues identified
  - **Decision Point**: Epic completion approach <!-- decision-id: D2 -->

- [ ] Step 3.3: Create Epic Completion Plan <!-- step-id: 3.3, agent: po, task: create-completion-plan -->
  - **Agent**: Product Owner
  - **Action**: Plan sequence for remaining Epic 23 stories
  - **Output**: Epic 23 completion roadmap
  - **Scope**: Stories 23.1, 23.5-23.8 implementation sequence

## Key Decision Points

1. **Bundle ID Strategy** (Step 1.1): <!-- decision-id: D1, status: pending -->
   - Trigger: Creating App Store Connect entry
   - Options: 
     - Use existing bundle ID pattern (com.growth.*)
     - Create new subscription-specific bundle ID
     - Multi-environment bundle IDs (dev/staging/prod)
   - Impact: Affects certificate setup and environment management
   - Decision Made: _Pending_

2. **Epic Completion Approach** (Step 3.2): <!-- decision-id: D2, status: pending -->
   - Trigger: After foundation is complete
   - Options:
     - Complete all remaining stories in sequence
     - Prioritize core monetization stories (23.1, 23.5, 23.6)
     - Defer analytics/monitoring stories (23.7, 23.8) to next sprint
   - Impact: Timeline and feature completeness
   - Decision Made: _Pending_

## Expected Outputs

### Infrastructure Documents
- [ ] App Store Connect configuration documentation

- [ ] Updated Firebase Functions configuration

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting this workflow, ensure you have:

- [ ] Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- [ ] Admin or Account Holder access to App Store Connect
- [ ] Firebase project access with Functions deployment permissions
- [ ] Existing Growth app codebase access
- [ ] Story 23.0 (infrastructure) and 23.2 (StoreKit) completed

## Risk Considerations

**Critical Risks:**
- **App Store Connect Setup Complexity**: First-time setup may reveal additional requirements
- **Credential Security**: Proper handling of private keys and API credentials essential
- **Integration Testing**: Coordination between multiple services increases complexity risk

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Document each setup step thoroughly for future reference
- Use Firebase Security Rules and environment variables for credential management
- Implement comprehensive test coverage before integration
- Maintain rollback procedures at each phase

## Customization Options

Based on your progress, you may:
- Skip Story 23.3b if local validation proves sufficient for MVP
- Add additional integration testing if coordination issues emerge
- Extend credential setup to include multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Defer Epic completion planning if foundation work reveals additional dependencies

## Success Criteria

This workflow succeeds when:
- [ ] Story 23.4 infrastructure dependency is resolved
- [ ] Story 23.3 is properly split and both phases implemented
- [ ] All Epic 23 dependency issues identified by Sarah are addressed
- [ ] Clear path forward exists for remaining Epic 23 stories
- [ ] Subscription infrastructure is functionally validated end-to-end

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** - Confirm it addresses Sarah's dependency concerns
2. **Begin with App Store Connect setup** (Step 1.1) - This unblocks everything else
3. **Start workflow execution**: Use `*agent dev` for technical steps, `*agent sm` for story creation
4. **Track progress** - Check off completed steps in this plan

## Notes

**From Sarah's Analysis:**
- Story 23.4 was identified as "FINAL PREREQUISITE" blocking all feature development
- The split story approach balances immediate progress with proper dependency management
- Integration risk between SubscriptionStateManager and existing SubscriptionEntitlementService requires careful coordination

**Technical Considerations:**
- Local state management can proceed without server infrastructure
- Server validation enhancement builds incrementally on local foundation
- Existing SubscriptionEntitlementService provides integration patterns to follow

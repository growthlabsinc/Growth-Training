# Debug Code Analysis Report

## Summary

The clean-debug-code.sh script found the following issues that need to be addressed before App Store release:

### üîç Findings

1. **Print Statements**: 1,492 instances
   - These should be replaced with Logger calls
   - Or marked with `// Release OK` if intentionally kept

2. **TODO/FIXME Comments**: 18 instances
   - Review and either complete or document why they're deferred

3. **Development URLs**: 210 instances
   - localhost, 127.0.0.1, or .local references
   - Need to ensure these are properly handled for production

## üìã Recommended Actions

### 1. Replace Print Statements with Logger

Instead of:
```swift
print("Button tapped")
```

Use:
```swift
Logger.debug("Button tapped")
```

### 2. Critical Files to Review

Based on the initial output, these files have print statements:
- `Growth/Core/UI/Components/Buttons/` - Multiple button components
- `Growth/Core/UI/Components/Markdown/MarkdownRenderer.swift`
- `Growth/Core/UI/Theme/` - Theme-related files
- Many more throughout the codebase

### 3. Bulk Replacement Strategy

For a quick fix, you could run:
```bash
# Create a backup first
cp -r Growth Growth.backup

# Replace simple print statements
find Growth -name "*.swift" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/print(/Logger.debug(/g' {} +
```

However, this requires:
1. Adding `import Foundation` to files that don't have it
2. Ensuring Logger.swift is accessible
3. Manual review for context-appropriate log levels

### 4. Alternative: Conditional Compilation

Keep prints but wrap them in DEBUG:
```swift
#if DEBUG
print("Debug message")
#endif
```

## üö® Priority Items

1. **Authentication/Payment Related**: Any print statements in authentication or payment flows should be removed immediately
2. **User Data**: Ensure no user data is being printed
3. **API Keys/Secrets**: Verify no sensitive information in prints

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

1. Run a targeted replacement for critical areas first
2. Use the Logger utility created in Story 25.2
3. Test thoroughly after replacements
4. Re-run the clean-debug-code.sh script to verify

Would you like me to:
1. Start replacing print statements with Logger calls?
2. Focus on specific critical areas first?
3. Create a script for bulk replacement?

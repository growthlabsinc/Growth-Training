# Live Activity 1:00:00 Display Fix

## Issue
Live Activity was always showing 1:00:00 regardless of the actual timer duration (e.g., 1-minute timer showed as 1:00:00).

## Root Cause
1. `TimerStateSync.startSyncing()` was not including `elapsedTimeAtLastUpdate` and `remainingTimeAtLastUpdate` in the initial contentState
2. Firebase function was receiving contentState without these values
3. The Firebase function's fallback logic was somehow resulting in `remainingTimeAtLastUpdate: 3600` (1 hour)
4. Additionally, endTime was being corrupted to `-17179867648` in some cases

## Fixes Applied

### 1. TimerStateSync.swift
- Added proper initialization of `elapsedTimeAtLastUpdate` and `remainingTimeAtLastUpdate` in `startSyncing()`
- Added `lastUpdateTime` and `lastKnownGoodUpdate` to contentState
- Added validation logging to trace timestamp values
- For countdown timers, `remainingTimeAtLastUpdate` is now properly set to the total duration

### 2. manageLiveActivityUpdates.js
- Added logging of raw contentState to debug timestamp issues
- Existing timestamp validation should now work with proper initial values

## Testing Steps
1. Build and run on device
2. Start a 1-minute timer
3. Verify Live Activity shows "0:01:00" NOT "1:00:00"
4. Test pause/resume functionality

## Expected Results
✅ Timer displays correct duration (0:01:00 for 1 minute)
✅ Pause button works without dismissing Live Activity
✅ No more invalid timestamp errors
✅ Proper time synchronization between app and widget

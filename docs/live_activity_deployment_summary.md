# Live Activity Push Updates - Deployment Summary

## Deployment Completed Successfully ✅

### What was deployed:

1. **Firebase Functions**
   - `updateLiveActivityTimer` - Callable function for manual Live Activity updates
   - `onTimerStateChange` - Firestore trigger that automatically sends push updates

### APNs Configuration Verified:
- **Team ID**: 62T6J77P6R
- **Key ID**: 3G84L8G52R
- **Bundle ID**: com.growth
- **Topic**: com.growth.push-type.liveactivity ✓

### Deployment Details:
- **Project**: growth-70a85
- **Region**: us-central1
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 (2nd Gen)
- **Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/growth-70a85/overview

## How the System Works:

1. **When a timer starts:**
   - Live Activity is created with push token support
   - Push token is stored in Firestore `liveActivityTokens` collection
   - `LiveActivityPushUpdateService` starts sending periodic updates

2. **Timer state changes:**
   - Changes are written to `activeTimers` collection
   - Firestore trigger (`onTimerStateChange`) detects changes
   - Push notification is sent to update Live Activity

3. **Periodic updates:**
   - Every 30 seconds, the app calls `updateLiveActivityTimer`
   - Function sends push notification with current timer state
   - Live Activity widget updates even when app is backgrounded

## Testing Instructions:

1. Start a timer in the Growth app
2. Verify Live Activity appears on lock screen/Dynamic Island
3. Background the app
4. Observe that the timer continues counting down
5. Check Firebase Functions logs for push notification activity

## Monitoring:

View function logs:
```bash
firebase functions:log --only updateLiveActivityTimer,onTimerStateChange
```

Check function status:
```bash
firebase functions:list
```

## Troubleshooting:

If Live Activities stop updating:
1. Check Firebase Functions logs for errors
2. Verify device has network connectivity
3. Ensure push tokens are being stored in Firestore
4. Confirm APNs authentication is working

## Next Steps:

1. Monitor production usage and error rates
2. Consider adjusting update interval based on battery impact
3. Add analytics to track Live Activity engagement
4. Implement error recovery for failed push notifications

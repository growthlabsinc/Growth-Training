# Live Activity Dismissal Solution

## Changes Made

### 1. Widget Direct Dismissal
Modified `TimerControlIntent` to directly end the Live Activity from the widget extension:
```swift
case .stop:
    // Try to end the activity directly from the widget
    print("ðŸ”´ TimerControlIntent: Stop requested - attempting to end activity")
    await LiveActivityUpdateManager.shared.endActivity(activityId: activityId)
    print("ðŸ”´ TimerControlIntent: Completed endActivity call")
```

### 2. File-Based Communication (Backup)
Implemented `AppGroupFileManager` in both main app and widget extension for file-based communication as a workaround for UserDefaults restrictions. However, this encounters permission issues in the widget extension.

### 3. Darwin Notification (Working)
The Darwin notification system is working correctly:
- Widget posts notification: `CFNotificationCenterPostNotification`
- Main app receives it via `TimerIntentObserver`
- This ensures the main app is notified even if the widget handles dismissal

## How It Works Now

1. User taps Stop button in Live Activity
2. `TimerControlIntent` is triggered with the stop action
3. Widget directly calls `LiveActivityUpdateManager.shared.endActivity()` to dismiss
4. Widget also posts Darwin notification to notify main app
5. Main app receives notification and updates its timer state

## Key Findings

- Widget extensions have limited permissions for shared containers
- CFPreferences error: "Using kCFPreferencesAnyUser with a container is only allowed for System Containers"
- Direct Live Activity dismissal from widget extension is the most reliable approach
- Darwin notifications work reliably for inter-process communication

## Testing

To test the solution:
1. Start a timer in the app
2. Background the app to see Live Activity
3. Tap Stop button on Live Activity
4. Live Activity should dismiss immediately
5. Return to app - timer should be stopped

Growth Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Intro
The "Growth" iOS application aims to provide adult men with a structured, private, and educational platform for learning and practicing the Growth Methodsâ€”a series of exercises intended to support penile vascular health. Existing resources are often fragmented and may lack authoritative, step-by-step guidance, leading to potential confusion or unsafe practices. This application will serve as a centralized, trustworthy, and discreet tool, offering clear instructions, progress tracking, educational content, and motivational support, with a foundational emphasis on user privacy and safety.

Goals and Context
Project Objectives:
Deliver a functional iOS application with clear, safe, step-by-step instructional content for all Growth Method stages (Beginner to Elite), including methods requiring external tools.
Implement a secure, private in-app system for users to log training sessions (method, duration, subjective feedback) and track progress.
Ensure users receive comprehensive safety disclaimers, usage guidelines, personalized readiness tracking with overtraining alerts, and information on consulting healthcare professionals.
Achieve positive user adoption and engagement within the first 6 months post-launch.
Measurable Outcomes:
Track app downloads and active user metrics (DAU/MAU).
Monitor user retention rates (Day 7, Day 30).
Measure average session duration and number of logged sessions.
Assess completion rates for Growth Method stages and user progression.
Gather qualitative feedback via App Store ratings/reviews and in-app surveys/mood check-ins.
Success Criteria:
MVP launch on iOS App Store meeting all specified functional and safety requirements.
Positive trend in user adoption and engagement KPIs within 6 months.
User feedback indicating clarity of instructions and a sense of safety and privacy.
No major security or privacy incidents.
Successful deployment of the AI Chat Coach within its defined MVP scope.

Scope and Requirements (MVP / Current Version)
Functional Requirements (High-Level)
User Onboarding & Setup:
Secure account creation (details to be defined by Architect, likely leveraging Firebase Authentication, with consideration for privacy).
Presentation and acceptance of comprehensive medical disclaimers, privacy policy, and terms of use.

Guided Growth Method Training System:
Access to detailed instructional content (text, visuals, potentially placeholder for animations) for all Growth Method stages (Beginner to Elite).
Information on required tools/equipment for each method.
Clear progression criteria and pathways between stages.
Modified "Methods Page Layout" (Dashboard-style with cards per stage: name, description, progress, CTA).
Progress and Health Tracking:
Manual session logging: date/time, method & class, duration, subjective user feedback/notes.
Visual dashboards: weekly/monthly charts for session consistency, calendar view, goal progression.
Personalized User Progression:
Readiness tracking algorithm (based on user input, session logs, progression criteria).
Overtraining alerts (triggered by frequency, duration, or negative subjective feedback).
Manual override of progression with ability to add notes.
Session-specific notes.
Educational Resources Center:
Access to articles and visuals on vascular health, ED myths, managing expectations, and safety.
Content organized into modules.
AI Chat Coach (Growth Coach) - MVP:
Interface for users to ask questions and receive text-based responses.
Answers questions about Growth Methods (as per app content), provides motivational support, helps navigate app content.
Clear disclaimers on scope and limitations (not medical advice).
In-App Exercise Timer:
Method-specific timers (countdown/stopwatch).
Alerts for breaks or overexertion (based on method guidelines).
Ability to tag time logs with session notes.
Gamification and Emotional Intelligence System (MVP Core):
Streaks for session consistency.

App launch time: <3 seconds.
AI Chat Coach response time: <5 seconds for typical queries.
Scalability:
System should handle a target of 10,000 active users within the first year without degradation. (Firebase/Firestore scales automatically, but application logic should be efficient).
Reliability/Availability:
Target uptime: 99.5% for backend services.
Graceful handling of offline scenarios (e.g., cached educational content, session logging with later sync).
Robust error handling and reporting.
Security:
End-to-end encryption for sensitive user data (data at rest on device and server, data in transit).
Secure user authentication and session management.
Adherence to iOS security best practices.
Regular security audits (post-MVP).
Protection against common mobile app vulnerabilities.
Anonymized logs where appropriate for analytics, ensuring no PHI leakage.
Maintainability:
Modular code architecture.
Comprehensive developer documentation.
Adherence to Swift/iOS coding standards.
Clear separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data).
Usability/Accessibility:
Intuitive navigation and user-friendly interface, calm, professional, supportive, discreet, icon-forward design.
Support for dynamic text sizing (iOS accessibility feature).
Good color contrast.
Adherence to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
Target WCAG 2.1 Level AA for accessibility where feasible for MVP.
Compliance:
Designed to support HIPAA compliance principles for U.S. users (requires BAA with Google Cloud for covered services, specific configurations for Firebase/Firestore).
Designed to support GDPR compliance principles for EU users (data processing agreements, user consent, data subject rights).
Strict adherence to Apple App Store guidelines (health, safety, mature content, privacy, AI).
Data Privacy:
Data minimization: Collect only necessary data.
Transparency: Clear privacy policy explaining data usage.
User Control: Mechanisms for users to manage their data (e.g., export, deletion requests - to be fully explored for MVP vs. future).
Secure on-device storage practices.
Content Accuracy & Safety:
All instructional and educational content must be vetted, accurate, and aligned with "Growth Method" branding.
Prominent and repeated safety warnings and medical disclaimers.
Other Constraints:
Platform: iOS native first. Android planned as near-term follow-up.
Budget & Timeline: TBD, will influence MVP scope refinement if necessary.
AI Chatbot Scope: MVP AI is for guidance and motivation from curated content, not medical diagnosis.

## Testing Strategy Documentation (Draft 1)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the high-level testing strategy for the "Growth" iOS application and its backend services. The goal is to ensure a high-quality, reliable, secure, and compliant application that meets user expectations and product requirements. This strategy will be further detailed by the Test Engineering team.

**2. Guiding Principles**

* **Early Testing:** Integrate testing throughout the development lifecycle, starting from requirements and design phases.
* **Automation Focus:** Automate repetitive tests (unit, integration, UI where feasible) to ensure consistency and speed up regression testing.
* **Risk-Based Testing:** Prioritize testing efforts based on the risk and impact of potential failures in different components (e.g., AI Coach safety, data privacy, core functionality).
* **Continuous Testing:** Incorporate testing into the CI/CD pipeline to provide rapid feedback.
* **User-Centric Testing:** Validate that the application is usable, valuable, and meets the needs of the target audience.
* **Compliance Testing:** Explicitly test for adherence to GDPR, Apple App Store guidelines, and other relevant privacy/security requirements.

**3. Levels and Types of Testing**

**3.1. iOS Application (Client-Side)**

* **Unit Tests (Swift - XCTest):**
    * **Scope:** Individual functions, methods, classes, ViewModels.
    * **Focus:** Business logic within ViewModels, utility functions, data model validation, service layer interactions (with mocks).
    * **Tools:** XCTest framework, XCMetrics.
    * **Goal:** Verify correctness of individual components in isolation.
* **Integration Tests (Swift - XCTest):**
    * **Scope:** Interactions between different client-side components (e.g., View-ViewModel, ViewModel-Service, Service-Local Persistence).
    * **Focus:** Data flow, navigation logic, interaction with mocked Firebase SDK responses.
    * **Tools:** XCTest framework.
    * **Goal:** Ensure components work together as expected within the client.
* **UI Tests (Swift - XCUITest):**
    * **Scope:** User interface flows and interactions.
    * **Focus:** Critical user paths (onboarding, logging a session, interacting with AI Coach, viewing methods, timer usage, consent flows ).
    * **Tools:** XCUITest framework.
    * **Goal:** Verify UI elements behave as expected and user flows are functional. To be used judiciously due to maintenance overhead.
* **Snapshot Tests (Optional):**
    * **Scope:** Visual regression testing for UI components.
    * **Tools:** Third-party libraries like `SnapshotTesting` by Point-Free.
    * **Goal:** Catch unintended UI changes.
* **Performance Tests:**
    * **Scope:** App launch time, UI responsiveness, resource usage (CPU, memory).
    * **Tools:** Xcode Instruments (Time Profiler, Allocations, Leaks), Firebase Performance Monitoring.
    * **Goal:** Ensure app meets performance NFRs (e.g., launch <3s, UI interactions <200ms ).
* **Accessibility Tests:**
    * **Scope:** Adherence to accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 Level AA where feasible ).
    * **Tools:** Xcode Accessibility Inspector, VoiceOver testing.
    * **Goal:** Ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities.
* **Security Tests (Client-Side):**
    * **Scope:** Secure on-device storage (Keychain for sensitive items - Story 10.1), protection against common mobile vulnerabilities (OWASP Mobile Top 10 relevant items).
    * **Tools:** Manual review, static analysis tools (if available).
    * **Goal:** Identify and mitigate client-side security risks.

**3.2. Firebase Cloud Functions (Backend - Python)**

* **Unit Tests (Python - `unittest` or `pytest`):**
    * **Scope:** Individual Python functions, classes, and modules within the Cloud Functions codebase (e.g., RAG orchestration logic, prompt construction, history management, DLP service interaction).
    * **Focus:** Business logic, data transformations, interactions with mocked GCP client libraries (Firestore, Vertex AI, DLP).
    * **Tools:** `unittest` (standard library) or `pytest` (recommended for richer features), `unittest.mock`. Firebase Local Emulator Suite can be used for some interactions.
    * **Goal:** Verify correctness of individual backend components.
* **Integration Tests (Python - `pytest` with Firebase Local Emulator Suite):**
    * **Scope:** Interactions between different parts of a Cloud Function or between a function and emulated Firebase services (Firestore, Auth).
    * **Focus:** End-to-end flow of a single function (e.g., `processGrowthCoachQuery` from request to (mocked) AI response and Firestore write), Firestore triggers.
    * **Tools:** `pytest`, Firebase Local Emulator Suite.
    * **Goal:** Ensure function components integrate correctly and interact with emulated services as expected.
* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Limited Scope for Backend):**
    * **Scope:** Full flow from a simulated client request through the Cloud Function to actual (sandboxed/test) GCP services (Vertex AI Search, Gemini, Firestore).
    * **Focus:** Validating the integration with live GCP services, especially the AI Coach RAG pipeline. Test key AI Coach scenarios with curated knowledge.
    * **Tools:** `pytest` or custom scripts making HTTPS requests to deployed test functions. Requires a dedicated test GCP project or careful data isolation.
    * **Goal:** Verify critical backend flows work with actual cloud services. Test AI Chat Coach responses against curated knowledge and for appropriate disclaimers .
* **Security Tests (Backend):**
    * **Scope:** IAM permissions (least privilege), Firestore security rules, App Check enforcement, input validation, secure logging (DLP integration).
    * **Tools:** Manual review, GCP Security Command Center (for broader project security), testing Firestore rules with Emulator.
    * **Goal:** Identify and mitigate backend security risks.
* **Performance & Load Tests (Backend - Optional for MVP, more critical post-launch):**
    * **Scope:** Cloud Function response times, scalability under concurrent load.
    * **Tools:** Artillery.io, k6, or custom scripts against deployed test functions. Cloud Monitoring for performance metrics.
    * **Goal:** Ensure backend meets performance NFRs (e.g., AI Coach response <5s , scalability for 10k users ).

**3.3. Compliance Testing**

* **GDPR Compliance:**
    * **Scope:** Consent mechanisms (Story 2.3, 2.4), data minimization (audit what's stored), Right to Erasure (Story 10.2, API for `deleteUserData`), data access, data residency configurations, secure logging (DLP).
    * **Method:** Manual review of implementation against requirements, test scripts for data deletion, verification of data storage locations.
    * **Goal:** Ensure adherence to GDPR principles.
* **Apple App Store Guideline Compliance (Story 10.4):**
    * **Scope:** Review against guidelines related to health, safety, mature content, user data privacy, and AI.
    * **Method:** Manual checklist review before submission.
    * **Goal:** Maximize chances of App Store approval.

**4. Testing Environments**

* **Local Development:** Firebase Local Emulator Suite for backend functions (Auth, Functions, Firestore). Xcode simulators/devices for iOS.
* **Development/Integration Environment (GCP Project):** Deployed functions and iOS builds for integration testing with actual (sandboxed) GCP services.
* **Staging Environment (GCP Project - Optional but Recommended):** A production-like environment for UAT, E2E testing, and final validation before release. Uses its own data.
* **Production Environment (GCP Project):** Live user environment. Monitoring is key.

**5. Test Data Management**

* **Source:** For unit/integration tests, use hardcoded mock data or generated data. For E2E/UAT, use curated, anonymized (if based on real data), or representative fictional data.
* **Knowledge Base:** Use a specific, versioned subset of the Growth Method and Educational Resource content for testing the AI Coach's RAG capabilities and response accuracy.
* **Privacy:** No real production user data should be used in non-production environments. If production data is ever used for diagnostics (with extreme caution and user consent if applicable), it must be anonymized/de-identified.

**6. Defect Management**

* **Tool:** JIRA, GitHub Issues, or similar.
* **Process:** Log defects with clear steps to reproduce, severity, priority, and assignees. Track defects through their lifecycle (Open, In Progress, In Review, Resolved, Closed).

**7. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Developers:** Responsible for writing unit tests and participating in integration testing for their code.
* **Test Engineers (QA Team):** Responsible for developing and executing integration, E2E, UI, performance, and compliance test plans. Managing test environments and test data. Automating tests.
* **Product Owner/PM:** Involved in UAT, defining acceptance criteria.
* **Architect:** Reviews test strategy for architectural alignment.

**8. CI/CD Integration**

* Unit tests and linters should run automatically on every commit/PR.
* Integration tests should run on PRs to the `develop` or `main` branch.
* Automated builds and deployments to test environments.

# Live Activity Dismissal Debug Summary

## Issue
The Live Activity stop button triggers a Darwin notification that the main app receives, but:
1. No file is created in the app group container by the widget
2. UserDefaults shows nil values due to CFPreferences restrictions
3. The Live Activity doesn't dismiss

## Root Cause
The widget extension has limited permissions:
- CFPreferences error: "Using kCFPreferencesAnyUser with a container is only allowed for System Containers"
- File-based communication is implemented but the widget can't write to the app group container

## Debugging Added
1. Enhanced logging in `AppGroupFileManager` for both app and widget
2. Container URL verification
3. File existence checks
4. Directory listing for debugging

## Current Status
- Darwin notifications are successfully sent and received
- File-based communication code is implemented but not working due to permissions
- The main app is ready to handle the dismissal once it receives the action

## Next Steps
1. Consider using push notifications to update/dismiss Live Activities instead of local communication
2. Investigate if the widget needs additional entitlements or capabilities
3. Consider having the main app poll for Live Activity state changes
4. Use the Firebase function to handle Live Activity dismissal via push updates

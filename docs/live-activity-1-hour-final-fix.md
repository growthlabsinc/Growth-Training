# Live Activity 1:00:00 Display Fix - FINAL SOLUTION

## Problem
Live Activity was always showing 1:00:00 regardless of the actual timer duration because the widget was receiving NSDate reference timestamps (e.g., 774327044) but treating them as Unix timestamps.

## Root Cause Analysis
From the Xcode logs:
```
⚠️ Decoded invalid Unix timestamp for endTime: 774327044.740041, using 1 hour from now
- Decoded endTime from Unix timestamp: 774327044.740041 -> 2025-07-16 03:35:44 +0000
```

The widget was receiving timestamps like `774327044` which are NSDate reference timestamps (seconds since 2001-01-01), but the validation logic thought they were invalid Unix timestamps because they're less than 1577836800 (2020-01-01 in Unix time). This caused the widget to default to `Date().addingTimeInterval(3600)` - always 1 hour from now.

## The Fix
Updated `TimerActivityAttributes.swift` in the widget to detect and convert NSDate reference timestamps:

1. **Detection**: If a timestamp is between 0 and 978307200 (the number of seconds between 1970 and 2001), it's likely an NSDate reference timestamp.

2. **Conversion**: Add 978307200 to convert from NSDate reference to Unix timestamp.

3. **Fallback**: For invalid timestamps, use `remainingTimeAtLastUpdate` to calculate the proper endTime instead of defaulting to 1 hour.

## Code Changes
The fix was applied to all timestamp decoding in `TimerActivityAttributes.ContentState`:
- `startTime`
- `endTime` 
- `lastUpdateTime`
- `lastKnownGoodUpdate`

Example for endTime:
```swift
if endTimeInterval > 0 && endTimeInterval < 978307200 {
    // NSDate reference timestamp - convert to Unix
    let unixTimestamp = endTimeInterval + 978307200
    self.endTime = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: unixTimestamp)
} else if endTimeInterval < 1577836800 {
    // Invalid timestamp - calculate from remainingTime
    if let remainingTime = try? container.decode(TimeInterval.self, forKey: .remainingTimeAtLastUpdate) {
        self.endTime = self.startTime.addingTimeInterval(remainingTime)
    } else {
        self.endTime = self.startTime.addingTimeInterval(60) // 1 minute fallback
    }
}
```

## Testing
1. Build and run on device
2. Start a 1-minute timer
3. Verify Live Activity shows "0:01:00" (not "1:00:00")
4. Test pause/resume functionality

## Expected Results
✅ Timer displays correct duration (0:01:00 for 1 minute, 0:05:00 for 5 minutes, etc.)
✅ No more "using 1 hour from now" warnings in logs
✅ Timestamps properly converted between NSDate reference and Unix epochs
✅ Pause functionality works without dismissing Live Activity

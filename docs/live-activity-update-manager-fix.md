# LiveActivityUpdateManager Fix

## Issue
The LiveActivityUpdateManager.swift file was:
1. Using the old TimerActivityAttributes structure with fields that no longer exist
2. Violating Apple's guidelines by updating Live Activity directly from widget with `await activity.update()`

## Solution
Rewrote the file to follow Apple's documented best practices:

### Key Changes
1. **Removed direct Live Activity updates**
   - No more `await activity.update()` calls
   - No more `await activity.end()` calls

2. **Store state for main app to process**
   - `storeActivityState()` - stores pause/resume state in App Group
   - `storeEndState()` - stores stop action for main app

3. **Simplified logic**
   - Works with the new simplified TimerActivityAttributes structure
   - Calculates elapsed time correctly based on current state
   - Main app handles all actual Live Activity updates via push

### Apple's Guidelines
According to Apple's documentation on Live Activities:
- Widgets should NOT update Live Activities directly
- Use App Intents to handle user interactions
- Store state changes for the main app to process
- Main app updates Live Activity via push notifications

### Current Flow
1. User taps pause/stop in Live Activity
2. TimerControlIntent stores action in App Group
3. TimerControlIntent posts Darwin notification
4. Main app receives notification
5. Main app updates Live Activity via push

This ensures consistent state and follows Apple's recommended patterns.

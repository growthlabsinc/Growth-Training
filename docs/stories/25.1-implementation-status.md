## Implementation Details

### Product Identifiers Updated
```swift
// Old format
com.growthlabs.growthmethod.subscription.basic.monthly

// New format
com.growthlabs.growthmethod.basic_monthly
```

### Subscription Group Configuration
```swift
struct SubscriptionGroupConfig {
    static let groupIdentifier = "growth_membership"
    static let groupName = "Growth Membership"
    static let trialPeriodDays = 7
    static let familySharingEnabled = true
}
```

## Next Steps for App Store Connect

1. **Create App Record**
   - Log into App Store Connect
   - Create new iOS app
   - Use bundle ID: `com.growthlabs.growthmethod`
   - SKU: GROWTH2025

2. **Configure Subscriptions**
   - Create subscription group "Growth Membership"
   - Add three products with IDs from SubscriptionProduct.swift
   - Set pricing tiers as specified

3. **Generate API Keys**
   - Create key with required permissions
   - Download .p8 file
   - Store securely using template guidelines

4. **Configure Server Notifications**
   - Production: `https://us-central1-growth-70a85.cloudfunctions.net/handleAppStoreNotification`
   - Sandbox: `https://us-central1-growth-70a85.cloudfunctions.net/handleAppStoreNotificationSandbox`

# Story 1.3: Set Up Google Cloud Project

## Status
Done

## Story

  - [x] Click "Enable" button
  - [x] Wait for API activation (may take 1-2 minutes)
  - [x] Verify API is enabled in "Enabled APIs" list

- [x] Task 4: Configure IAM Permissions for Vertex AI (AC: 3)
  - [x] Navigate to IAM & Admin → IAM
  - [x] Find Firebase Functions service account
  - [x] Click "Edit" (pencil icon)
  - [x] Add roles:
    - [x] Vertex AI User
    - [x] Service Account Token Creator (if not present)
  - [x] Save changes
  - [x] Document service account email for Functions deployment

- [x] Task 5: Create AI-specific Service Account (AC: 3)
  - [x] Navigate to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts
  - [x] Click "Create Service Account"
  - [x] Name: "vertex-ai-integration"
  - [x] Description: "Service account for Vertex AI integration in Cloud Functions"
  - [x] Click "Create and Continue"
  - [x] Add roles:
    - [x] Vertex AI User
    - [x] Cloud Functions Invoker
  - [x] Click "Done"
  - [x] Generate JSON key for local testing (optional)

- [x] Task 6: Configure Billing and Quotas (AC: 4)
  - [x] Navigate to Billing → Account Management
  - [x] Verify Blaze plan is active (should be from Firebase)
  - [x] Set up budget alerts for Vertex AI:
    - [x] Navigate to Budgets & alerts
    - [x] Create budget for "Vertex AI"
    - [x] Set thresholds: $50, $100, $500
  - [x] Check Vertex AI quotas:
    - [x] Navigate to IAM & Admin → Quotas
    - [x] Filter by "Vertex AI"
    - [x] Note default quotas for requests per minute
    - [x] Request increases if needed for production

- [x] Task 7: Enable Additional Required APIs
  - [x] Enable Cloud Resource Manager API
  - [x] Enable Cloud Billing API
  - [x] Enable Identity and Access Management (IAM) API
  - [x] Enable Service Usage API
  - [x] Document all enabled APIs

- [x] Task 8: Verify and Document Configuration
  - [x] Test Vertex AI API access via Cloud Shell
  - [x] Document all service account emails
  - [x] Update docs/gcp-config.md with:
    - [x] Project ID and number
    - [x] Enabled APIs list
    - [x] Service account details
    - [x] Billing configuration
    - [x] Quota limits

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Stories 1.1 and 1.2:
- Firebase project created: growth-training-app
- All Firebase services enabled and configured
- Project Number: 997901246801
- Owner: jon@growthlabs.coach (has full access)
- Billing: Blaze plan active

### Google Cloud Project Details
When Firebase project is created, it automatically creates a linked GCP project:
- GCP Project ID: growth-training-app (same as Firebase)
- Default region: us-central1 (for Cloud Functions)
- Billing: Shared with Firebase (Blaze plan)

### Vertex AI Integration Requirements
[Source: CLAUDE.md#AI Coach Integration]
- Vertex AI API required for AI Coach feature
- Integration via Firebase Functions (Node.js 20)
- Knowledge base augmentation from Firestore
- Real-time streaming responses

### Service Account Configuration
[Source: Firebase Functions documentation]
Default Firebase Functions service account needs these roles:
- Cloud Functions Developer
- Service Account Token Creator
- Vertex AI User (for AI features)

### Vertex AI API Quotas
Default quotas that may need adjustment:
- Requests per minute: 60 (may need increase for production)
- Prediction requests per minute: 10
- Online prediction requests per model: 100
- Consider requesting quota increases before launch

### Security Best Practices
[Source: GCP Security Best Practices]
- Use least-privilege principle for service accounts
- Enable audit logging for API access
- Set up alerts for unusual API usage
- Never commit service account keys to repository
- Use Application Default Credentials in production

### Cost Considerations
Vertex AI pricing:
- Text generation: ~$0.0005 per 1K characters
- Embeddings: ~$0.0001 per 1K characters
- Monitor usage closely with budget alerts
- Consider implementing rate limiting in app

### Testing Vertex AI Access
Test command for Cloud Shell:
```bash
gcloud ai models list --region=us-central1
```

### Firebase Functions Deployment
After GCP setup, Functions deployment will use:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:generateAIResponse
```
The function will automatically use the configured service account.

### Critical Implementation Notes
[Source: CLAUDE.md#CRITICAL: Project Status]
- This is a 100% functional brownfield project
- DO NOT change any app functionality
- ONLY configure GCP services as required
- Vertex AI integration already exists in code

### Multi-Environment Considerations
For now, focusing on production environment:
- Production: growth-training-app
- Development and staging will use same GCP project
- Environment separation handled at Firebase Functions level

## Testing
Manual verification steps:
1. Vertex AI API shows as "Enabled" in GCP Console
2. Service accounts have correct permissions
3. Test API call succeeds from Cloud Shell
4. Budget alerts are configured
5. Documentation is complete

# Story 1.2: Configure Firebase Services

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to enable all required Firebase services,
**so that** the app has full backend functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All services showing "enabled" status
2. Initial security rules configured
3. Database indexes created

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Enable Firebase Authentication (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Navigate to Firebase Console → Authentication
  - [ ] Click "Get started" to enable Authentication
  - [ ] Enable Email/Password provider in Sign-in method tab
  - [ ] Enable Google provider and configure with OAuth consent
  - [ ] Enable Anonymous authentication for guest users
  - [ ] Configure authorized domains (add growthlabs.coach if needed)

- [ ] Task 2: Set up Firestore Database (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Navigate to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
  - [ ] Click "Create database"
  - [ ] Select production mode (start with secure rules)
  - [ ] Choose multi-region location (nam5 for US central)
  - [ ] Configure initial security rules for authenticated users
  - [ ] Create necessary indexes for the app's queries

- [ ] Task 3: Configure Cloud Functions (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Navigate to Firebase Console → Functions
  - [ ] Verify Blaze plan is active (required for Functions)
  - [ ] Note the Functions dashboard is ready for deployment
  - [ ] Document Functions endpoint URL for later configuration

- [ ] Task 4: Enable Analytics & Crashlytics (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Navigate to Firebase Console → Analytics
  - [ ] Click "Enable Google Analytics" if not already enabled
  - [ ] Configure data retention settings
  - [ ] Navigate to Firebase Console → Crashlytics
  - [ ] Click "Enable Crashlytics"
  - [ ] Note: Full setup requires SDK integration in app

- [ ] Task 5: Set up Cloud Messaging (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Navigate to Firebase Console → Cloud Messaging
  - [ ] Note the Server Key and Sender ID
  - [ ] Configure FCM settings for iOS
  - [ ] Document FCM Server Key for backend configuration
  - [ ] Note: APNS certificates needed (Story 1.4)

- [ ] Task 6: Configure App Check (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Navigate to Firebase Console → App Check
  - [ ] Click "Get started" with App Check
  - [ ] Register app with App Attest provider for iOS
  - [ ] Configure enforcement for each service:
    - [ ] Firestore: Start in monitor mode
    - [ ] Authentication: Start in monitor mode
    - [ ] Cloud Functions: Start in monitor mode
    - [ ] Cloud Storage: Start in monitor mode (if using)
  - [ ] Document debug token process for development

- [ ] Task 7: Configure Security Rules (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Update Firestore security rules for basic authentication
  - [ ] Set up rules for ai_coach_knowledge collection
  - [ ] Configure rules for user data collections
  - [ ] Test rules in Firebase Console Rules Simulator

- [ ] Task 8: Document Service Configuration
  - [ ] Update docs/firebase-config.md with enabled services
  - [ ] Document service-specific configuration details
  - [ ] Note any service URLs or keys needed for app configuration

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 1.1:
- Firebase project created: growth-training-app
- Project ID: growth-training-app
- Project Number: 997901246801
- Web API Key: AIzaSyC8ZuIdw6ITfno5m2p0RK7qIrQmY2X7LPU
- Billing: Blaze plan already configured
- Owner: jon@growthlabs.coach (accepted - has full admin access)

### Firebase Services Requirements
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Firebase Integration]
Required Firebase services for the Growth Training app:
- **FirebaseAuth** - Authentication with Google Sign-In support
- **FirebaseFirestore** - Primary database for all app data
- **FirebaseFunctions** - Backend for AI Coach and Live Activity updates
- **FirebaseAnalytics** - User behavior tracking
- **FirebaseCrashlytics** - Crash reporting and diagnostics
- **FirebaseAppCheck** - App integrity verification
- **FirebaseMessaging** - Push notifications for Live Activities

### Firestore Collections Structure
[Source: CLAUDE.md#AI Coach Knowledge Base]
Key collections that will be used:
- `ai_coach_knowledge` - Knowledge base for AI Coach responses
- User data collections (to be defined based on app requirements)
- Session logs for progress tracking

### Security Considerations
[Source: CLAUDE.md#App Check Configuration]
- App Check should start in monitor mode before enforcement
- Debug tokens required for development testing
- Each service can have independent enforcement settings
- Use environment variable: `FIRAAppCheckDebugToken` for debug tokens

### Cloud Functions Requirements
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Firebase Functions]
Functions will be deployed from `/functions/` directory and include:
- AI Coach with Vertex AI integration
- Live Activity push notification handlers
- User data management functions
- Analytics processing functions

### Multi-Environment Considerations
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Multi-Environment Configuration]
While configuring services, keep in mind:
- Development, staging, and production environments will be needed
- Each environment may have different security rules
- Service configurations should support environment switching

### Critical Implementation Notes
[Source: CLAUDE.md#CRITICAL: Project Status]
- This is a 100% functional brownfield project
- DO NOT change any app functionality
- ONLY configure Firebase services as required
- Preserve all existing app functionality

### Testing
Manual verification of all services through Firebase Console:
- Each service shows as "Enabled" in console
- Security rules are active and tested
- Basic database operations can be performed
- App Check shows monitoring data

## Detailed Specifications

### Analytics Event Taxonomy

#### Funnel Steps
```swift
enum FunnelStep: String, CaseIterable {
    case paywallImpression = "paywall_impression"
    case featureHighlightView = "feature_highlight_view"
    case pricingOptionView = "pricing_option_view"
    case purchaseInitiated = "purchase_initiated"
    case purchaseCompleted = "purchase_completed"
    case purchaseFailed = "purchase_failed"
    case paywallDismissed = "paywall_dismissed"
    case exitIntentDetected = "exit_intent_detected"
    case retentionOfferShown = "retention_offer_shown"
    case retentionOfferAccepted = "retention_offer_accepted"
}
```

#### User Cohorts
```swift
enum UserCohort: String {
    case newUser = "new_user"
    case returningFreeUser = "returning_free_user"
    case trialUser = "trial_user"
    case expiredSubscriber = "expired_subscriber"
    case activePowerUser = "active_power_user"
}
```

### A/B Testing Experiments

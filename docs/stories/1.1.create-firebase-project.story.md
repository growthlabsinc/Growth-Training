## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
No previous story exists - this is the first story for the Growth Training rebrand project.

### Firebase Configuration Details
[Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Current production Firebase project: growth-70a85 (to be replaced)
- Multi-environment setup required (development, staging, production)
- Firebase services needed:
  - Authentication (with Google Sign-In)
  - Firestore Database
  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 20)
  - Analytics
  - Crashlytics
  - App Check
  - Cloud Messaging (for push notifications)

### Project Structure Notes
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Multi-Environment Configuration]
```swift
enum FirebaseEnvironment: String {
    case development = "dev"
    case staging = "staging"
    case production = "prod"
}
```
- Each environment will need its own GoogleService-Info.plist file stored in `Growth/Resources/Plist/`
- Environment switching is handled by `FirebaseClient.swift`

### Critical Implementation Notes
[Source: CLAUDE.md#CRITICAL: Project Status]
- **This is a 100% functional brownfield project** - all features are fully implemented
- DO NOT change any UI functionality or behavior
- DO NOT modify core app logic or features
- ONLY update Firebase configuration and environment settings
- The app is production-ready and live - preserve all existing functionality

### Firebase Services Configuration Requirements
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Firebase Integration]
The following services will need to be enabled in subsequent stories:
- FirebaseAuth - Authentication with Google Sign-In
- FirebaseFirestore - Primary database
- FirebaseFunctions - AI Coach, Live Activity updates
- FirebaseAnalytics - User behavior tracking
- FirebaseCrashlytics - Crash reporting
- FirebaseAppCheck - App integrity verification
- FirebaseMessaging - Push notifications

### Billing Considerations
- Firebase Blaze plan required for:
  - Cloud Functions deployment
  - Vertex AI integration (AI Coach feature)
  - APNS for push notifications
  - Extended usage beyond free tier limits

### Testing
No specific testing requirements for this infrastructure setup story. Manual verification of Firebase Console access and configuration.

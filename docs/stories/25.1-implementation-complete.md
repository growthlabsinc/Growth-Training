# Story 25.1 Implementation Complete

## Summary

Story 25.1 (App Store Connect Configuration) has been fully implemented with the actual API key provided.

## What Was Completed

### 1. API Key Integration
- Copied AuthKey_2AK48N7L5J.p8 to secure `.keys/` directory
- Set proper file permissions (600)
- Added `.keys/` to .gitignore for security

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.local` with:
  - APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID=2AK48N7L5J
  - APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=69a6de85-a1f9-47e3-e053-5b8c7c11a4d1
  - APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./.keys/AuthKey_2AK48N7L5J.p8

### 3. Configuration Scripts
- Created `scripts/configure-appstore-connect.sh` - Sets up Firebase Functions config
- Created `scripts/validate-appstore-config.sh` - Validates the setup
- Both scripts are executable and ready to use

### 4. Documentation
- Created comprehensive setup guide with step-by-step instructions
- Documented all subscription product IDs and configurations
- Added security best practices

### 5. Code Updates (Previously Completed)
- SubscriptionProduct.swift updated with correct product IDs
- Subscription group changed to "growth_membership"
- All three tiers configured ($4.99, $9.99, $19.99)

## Files Created/Modified

1. `.keys/AuthKey_2AK48N7L5J.p8` - API key (gitignored)
2. `.env.local` - Environment configuration (gitignored)
3. `.gitignore` - Added `.keys/` directory
4. `scripts/configure-appstore-connect.sh` - Firebase configuration script
5. `scripts/validate-appstore-config.sh` - Validation script
6. `docs/app-store-connect-setup-guide.md` - Complete setup guide
7. `Growth/Core/Models/SubscriptionProduct.swift` - Updated product IDs

## Next Steps

1. **Manual App Store Connect Setup**:
   - Log into App Store Connect
   - Create app with bundle ID: com.growthlabs.growthmethod
   - Configure subscriptions using the setup guide
   - Generate shared secret

2. **After App Store Connect Setup**:
   - Update `.env.local` with the shared secret
   - Run `./scripts/configure-appstore-connect.sh` to update Firebase
   - Verify with `./scripts/validate-appstore-config.sh`

3. **Continue with Epic 25**:
   - Story 25.2: Production Build Setup
   - Story 25.3: App Store Assets
   - Story 25.4: Legal Documentation
   - Story 25.5: Production Infrastructure
   - Story 25.6: Beta Testing Program

## Security Considerations

✅ API key stored securely in `.keys/` directory
✅ Directory added to .gitignore
✅ File permissions set to 600
✅ Environment variables used for configuration
✅ No sensitive data committed to repository

## Definition of Done

- [x] App Store Connect API key integrated
- [x] Environment configuration created
- [x] Scripts for configuration and validation
- [x] Comprehensive documentation
- [x] Security measures in place
- [x] Ready for manual App Store Connect setup

The implementation is complete and ready for the App Store Connect configuration process.

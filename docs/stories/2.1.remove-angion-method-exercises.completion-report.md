# Story 2.1 Completion Report: Remove Angion Method Exercises

## Completion Date
2025-01-19

## Summary
Successfully removed the majority of Angion Method references from the Growth Training codebase as part of the content migration from Angion Method methodology to PE-focused training protocols.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Remove Angion Method exercise definitions from SampleGrowthMethods.swift
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Removed all 8 Angion method definitions (am1_0, am2_0, angion_method_1_0, angion_method_2_5, angion_method_3_0, vascion)
- Removed all 4 SABRE method variations (sabre_type_a, sabre_type_b, sabre_type_c, sabre_type_d)
- Updated aliases to point to remaining valid methods
- Retained 5 non-Angion methods: s2s_stretch, s2s_advanced, bfr_cyclic_bending, bfr_glans_pulsing, angio_pumping

### ✅ Task 4: Update AI Coach prompts to remove Angion references
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Removed `angionMethodMedical` case from `AIQueryCategory` enum
- Removed Angion-specific prompt templates
- Removed Angion keywords from categorizeQuery function
- Updated base system prompt to remove Angion-specific medical guidance

### ✅ Task 3: Update SampleRoutines.swift to remove Angion-based routines
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Replaced all references to Angion methods with valid growth methods
- Simplified the complex Janus Protocol (84-day routine) by removing it entirely
- Updated all routine descriptions to remove Angion terminology
- Updated method IDs in all routines to use only the 5 remaining valid methods

### ✅ Task 6: Archive old content for reference
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Created `/docs/archive/removed-angion-methods.md` with all removed method definitions
- Documented removal date and reason
- Preserved method definitions for historical reference

### ✅ Task 7: Verify no remaining references
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Verified removal from core service files
- Identified remaining UI component references (see below)

## Partially Completed Tasks

### ⚠️ Task 2: Clean up Angion references in UI components
- **Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- Updated PromptTemplateService.swift
- Updated DebugMockDataService.swift
- **Remaining Work**: Multiple UI view files still contain hardcoded references to Angion method IDs and images:
  - GrowthMethodDetailView.swift (image references for am1_0, am2_0, am2_5)
  - MethodCardView.swift
  - DailyRoutineView.swift
  - MethodSummaryRow.swift
  - And approximately 10 other view files

### ❌ Task 5: Clean Firestore database of old methods
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- Requires Firebase Functions or admin script to remove methods from production database
- Should remove methods with IDs: am1_0, am2_0, angion_method_1_0, angion_method_2_5, angion_method_3_0, vascion, sabre_type_a, sabre_type_b, sabre_type_c, sabre_type_d

## Files Modified
1. `/Growth/Core/Services/SampleGrowthMethods.swift` - Removed 12 method definitions
2. `/Growth/Core/Services/SampleRoutines.swift` - Complete rewrite, removed ~300 lines
3. `/Growth/Features/AICoach/Services/PromptTemplateService.swift` - Removed Angion AI categories
4. `/Growth/Core/Services/DebugMockDataService.swift` - Updated mock data methods
5. `/docs/archive/removed-angion-methods.md` - Created archive document

## Remaining Work for Full Completion
1. **UI Component Cleanup**: Approximately 15 Swift UI view files contain hardcoded references to Angion method IDs (e.g., checking if method.id == "am1_0"). These need to be updated to either:
   - Remove the conditional checks entirely
   - Replace with checks for the remaining valid method IDs
   - Update image asset references

2. **Firebase Database Cleanup**: Production Firestore database needs to be cleaned via:
   - Firebase Admin SDK script
   - Or Firebase Functions deployment
   - Must handle user routines that reference removed methods

3. **Asset Cleanup**: Image assets for Angion methods (am1_0, am2_0, am2_5, etc.) should be removed from Assets.xcassets

## Testing Recommendations
1. Build and run the app to ensure no crashes from removed methods
2. Test all routine views to ensure they display correctly with updated method IDs
3. Test AI Coach to ensure it doesn't reference removed methods
4. Create new routines to verify only valid methods are available
5. Test existing user routines that might reference removed methods (handle gracefully)

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW RISK**: Core functionality has been updated successfully
- **MEDIUM RISK**: UI components with hardcoded references may cause runtime issues if not all are found
- **HIGH RISK**: Production database contains user data referencing removed methods - needs careful migration

## Recommendation
The core removal of Angion methods is complete, but additional work is needed for full cleanup:
1. Complete UI component updates (est. 2-3 hours)
2. Deploy Firebase cleanup script (est. 1 hour)
3. Remove unused image assets (est. 30 minutes)
4. Comprehensive testing (est. 1-2 hours)

## Developer Notes
- Used simplified approach for SampleRoutines.swift due to extensive Janus Protocol complexity
- Archive file preserves all removed content for reference
- Some UI components have defensive checks for specific method IDs that need careful review

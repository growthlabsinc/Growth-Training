# Story 23.4: Feature Gating System Implementation

## Story Overview

**Epic:** 23 - Subscription & Monetization Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 23.4  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days  

## User Story

**As a** Developer  
**I want to** build a feature gating system to control access to premium features  
**So that** we can deliver the correct experience to users based on their subscription status

## Business Context

With the subscription infrastructure complete (Stories 23.0-23.3, 23.7), we need to implement the feature gating logic that determines which features users can access based on their subscription status. The app uses a simple two-tier model: Free (quick timer + articles) and Premium (all features), with flexible pricing options (1 week $4.79, 3 months $27.79, 12 months $54.99).

## Detailed Requirements

### Core Feature Gating Logic
- Implement access control logic for all designated premium features
- Create a centralized feature access service that integrates with SubscriptionStateManager
- Define clear separation between Free tier (quick timer + articles) and Premium tier (all features)
- Ensure graceful degradation for free users with clear premium feature indicators

### Trial Period Handling
- Implement trial period logic granting full access for limited time
- Handle trial expiration gracefully with appropriate user notifications
- Support trial periods for premium feature evaluation

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing SubscriptionStateManager.swift
- Connect to SubscriptionEntitlementService for feature mapping
- Ensure real-time updates when subscription status changes
- Support offline access for previously cached entitlements

## Technical Specifications

### Feature Definition Structure
```swift
enum FeatureType: String, CaseIterable {
    // Free Features
    case quickTimer = "quick_timer"
    case articles = "articles"
    
    // Premium Features (All paid tiers)
    case customRoutines = "custom_routines"
    case advancedTimer = "advanced_timer"
    case progressTracking = "progress_tracking"
    case advancedAnalytics = "advanced_analytics"
    case goalSetting = "goal_setting"
    case aiCoach = "ai_coach"
    case liveActivities = "live_activities"
    case prioritySupport = "priority_support"
    case unlimitedBackup = "unlimited_backup"
    case advancedCustomization = "advanced_customization"
    case expertInsights = "expert_insights"
    case premiumContent = "premium_content"
}
```

### Subscription Tier Mapping
```swift
enum SubscriptionTier: String, CaseIterable {
    case none = "none"
    case premium = "premium" // Single premium tier for all paid features
    
    var availableFeatures: Set<FeatureType> {
        switch self {
        case .none:
            return [.quickTimer, .articles]
        case .premium:
            return Set(FeatureType.allCases) // All features available
        }
    }
}

enum SubscriptionDuration: String, CaseIterable {
    case weekly = "weekly"
    case quarterly = "quarterly" 
    case yearly = "yearly"
    
    var displayName: String {
        switch self {
        case .weekly: return "1 Week"
        case .quarterly: return "3 Months"
        case .yearly: return "12 Months"
        }
    }
    
    var price: String {
        switch self {
        case .weekly: return "$4.79"
        case .quarterly: return "$27.79"
        case .yearly: return "$54.99"
        }
    }
}
```

### Implementation Components

#### 1. FeatureGateService.swift
- Central service for feature access checks
- Integration with SubscriptionStateManager
- Caching for offline access
- Real-time subscription status monitoring

#### 2. FeatureGate SwiftUI View Modifier
- Declarative UI gating using `.featureGated(_:)` modifier
- Automatic upgrade prompts for premium features
- Graceful fallback UI for restricted features

#### 3. FeatureAccessViewModel
- Observable object for UI state management
- Reactive updates when subscription changes
- Support for trial period countdown

#### 4. Integration Updates
- Update existing views to use feature gating
- Add premium indicators to restricted features
- Implement upgrade prompts and paywall triggers

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Core Feature Access Control
- **Given** a user with an active premium subscription  
- **When** they attempt to access any premium feature  
- **Then** they should have full access without restrictions

### AC2: Free User Restrictions
- **Given** a user without a subscription (free tier)  
- **When** they attempt to access a premium feature  
- **Then** they should be restricted with clear indication of premium requirement

### AC3: Trial Period Functionality
- **Given** a user in an active trial period  
- **When** they access any feature  
- **Then** they should have temporary access to all premium features  
- **And** trial status should be clearly indicated in the UI

### AC4: Trial Expiration Handling
- **Given** a user whose trial has expired  
- **When** they attempt to access premium features  
- **Then** access should be revoked gracefully with upgrade prompts

### AC5: Real-time Subscription Updates
- **Given** a user's subscription status changes  
- **When** the change is detected by the app  
- **Then** feature access should update immediately without app restart

### AC6: Offline Feature Access
- **Given** a user with cached subscription entitlements  
- **When** the app is offline  
- **Then** previously accessible features should remain available

## Implementation Plan

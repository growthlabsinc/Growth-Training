# Story 23.3a: Local Subscription State Management

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE (January 19, 2025)

## Story

- As a **Growth app user**
- I want **my subscription status to be consistently maintained locally across app sessions**
- so that **I can reliably access my subscribed features without interruption when offline or during network issues**

**Context:** This story implements the local state management portion of the original Story 23.3, focusing on coordinating subscription state between StoreKit 2 (Story 23.2) and the existing SubscriptionEntitlementService. This creates a foundation for consistent subscription state without requiring server validation, enabling immediate development progress while Story 23.4 infrastructure dependencies are resolved.

## Background

With StoreKit 2 integration (Story 23.2) providing purchase capabilities and the existing SubscriptionEntitlementService handling feature access, we need a local state coordination service that bridges StoreKit transaction monitoring with our entitlement system. This service will operate entirely with local validation until server infrastructure from Story 23.4 is available.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Local State Management
- [ ] Create SubscriptionStateManager service that monitors StoreKit transaction updates locally
- [ ] Implement automatic subscription state synchronization on app launch using local StoreKit data
- [ ] Provide real-time subscription status updates to UI components via Combine publishers
- [ ] Handle subscription expiration and renewal notifications from local StoreKit monitoring
- [ ] Manage subscription state persistence across app sessions using UserDefaults caching

### Local Service Integration
- [ ] Integrate with existing SubscriptionEntitlementService for feature access validation without breaking changes
- [ ] Coordinate with StoreKitService for transaction monitoring using local validation only
- [ ] Cache subscription state locally with proper timestamp-based invalidation
- [ ] Handle offline scenarios gracefully by relying on local StoreKit transaction history
- [ ] Synchronize local state between SubscriptionStateManager and SubscriptionEntitlementService

### Error Handling & Fallbacks
- [ ] Provide fallback mechanisms when StoreKit is unavailable using cached state
- [ ] Handle iOS version compatibility with appropriate fallbacks for pre-iOS 15.0 devices
- [ ] Log state management errors for debugging without server dependencies
- [ ] Implement proper Task cancellation and memory management for async monitoring

### App Lifecycle Integration
- [ ] Integrate with app lifecycle events (foreground/background) for state refresh
- [ ] Support paywalls and subscription UI components with real-time state updates
- [ ] Ensure proper initialization order with existing services during app startup
- [ ] Handle app termination and state persistence gracefully

## Technical Implementation

### Service Architecture
```swift
@available(iOS 15.0, *)
class SubscriptionStateManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var subscriptionState: SubscriptionState
    @Published var isLoading: Bool
    @Published var lastError: Error?
    
    private let storeKitService: StoreKitService
    private let entitlementService: SubscriptionEntitlementService
    private var transactionUpdateTask: Task<Void, Never>?
    private let localCache: SubscriptionStateCache
    
    // Local validation only - no server calls
    func validateSubscriptionLocally() async -> SubscriptionState
}
```

### State Model
```swift
struct SubscriptionState: Codable {
    let tier: SubscriptionTier
    let status: SubscriptionStatus  // active, expired, trial, cancelled
    let expirationDate: Date?
    let isTrialActive: Bool
    let autoRenewalEnabled: Bool
    let lastUpdated: Date
    let validationSource: ValidationSource // local, cached, server
}

enum ValidationSource: String, Codable {
    case local = "local"
    case cached = "cached"
    case server = "server"  // Not used in 23.3a
}
```

### Local Integration Points
- Consume StoreKit transaction updates from StoreKitService for local validation
- Update SubscriptionEntitlementService when local state changes
- Provide state to subscription UI components via Combine publishers
- Cache state locally using UserDefaults with proper versioning

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Story 23.2 completion, we have established StoreKitService patterns for transaction monitoring and PurchaseManager for purchase orchestration. [Source: ai/stories/23.2.story.md]

### iOS Architecture Context
- **Platform**: iOS with Swift 5.10+, SwiftUI for UI components [Source: Technology Stack Specification.md]
- **State Management**: Use SwiftUI `@StateObject`/`@ObservedObject` patterns with Combine publishers [Source: CLAUDE.md#Key Patterns and Conventions]
- **Service Patterns**: Singleton services accessed via `.shared`, following existing pattern [Source: CLAUDE.md#Key Patterns and Conventions]

### Service Integration Requirements
- **StoreKit 2**: Requires iOS 15.0+ with `#available` checks for backward compatibility [Source: Technology Stack Specification.md#iOS Application]
- **Combine Framework**: For reactive state updates following app patterns [Source: CLAUDE.md#State Management]
- **UserDefaults**: For local persistence of subscription state cache [Source: Technology Stack Specification.md#Local Data Persistence]

### File Locations
Based on Growth app architecture: [Source: CLAUDE.md#Core Architecture Pattern]
- `Growth/Core/Services/SubscriptionStateManager.swift` (new) - Main service in Core Services
- `Growth/Core/Models/SubscriptionState.swift` (new) - State models in Core Models  
- `Growth/Core/Models/SubscriptionStateCache.swift` (new) - Local cache models
- `Growth/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` (integrate) - UI integration point

### Integration with Existing Services
- **SubscriptionEntitlementService**: Located at `Growth/Core/Services/SubscriptionEntitlementService.swift`, handles feature access [Source: CLAUDE.md#Key Services]
- **StoreKitService**: From Story 23.2, provides transaction monitoring [Source: ai/stories/23.2.story.md]
- **PurchaseManager**: From Story 23.2, handles purchase orchestration [Source: ai/stories/23.2.story.md]

### Technical Constraints
- **Threading**: Firebase operations on background queues, UI updates on main thread [Source: CLAUDE.md#Threading Considerations]
- **Memory Management**: Use weak self captures in closures, proper Task cancellation [Source: CLAUDE.md#Performance Optimizations]
- **Error Handling**: Use Result types or completion handlers with optional errors [Source: CLAUDE.md#Key Patterns and Conventions]

### Testing Requirements
Based on app testing strategy: [Source: CLAUDE.md#Testing Strategy]
- Unit tests for Services and ViewModels using mock services
- Integration tests for service coordination scenarios

# Story 23.4: App Store Connect API Credentials Configuration

## Status: Ready for Review (Enhanced per PO feedback)

## Story

- As a **Product Owner**
- I want **to configure App Store Connect API credentials and complete the subscription infrastructure deployment**
- so that **all Epic 23 subscription functionality can be activated and begin generating revenue through our tiered subscription model**

**Context:** This is the final prerequisite story for Epic 23. Story 23.0 deployed the infrastructure, and Stories 23.3a/b built the client-side management. This story configures the credentials needed to activate the complete subscription system, unblocking all remaining Epic 23 stories.

## Background

The subscription infrastructure is fully deployed and tested in development, but requires App Store Connect API credentials to enable:
- Server-side receipt validation with Apple
- App Store Server Notifications (webhooks)
- Subscription status verification
- Production deployment validation

This story focuses on the secure configuration of these credentials and validation of the complete end-to-end subscription flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Credential Generation & Configuration
- [ ] App Store Connect API key generated with proper permissions
- [ ] Private key (.p8 file) securely obtained and stored
- [ ] Key ID, Issuer ID, and Bundle ID documented
- [ ] Firebase Functions environment variables configured
- [ ] Private key file uploaded to secure cloud storage

### Infrastructure Validation
- [ ] Receipt validation endpoint successfully validates test receipts
- [ ] Webhook endpoint receives and processes test notifications
- [ ] Subscription state synchronizes across devices via Firestore
- [ ] Error handling and monitoring systems operational
- [ ] Security audit of credential storage and access

### Documentation & Handoff
- [ ] Credential storage location documented
- [ ] Access control and rotation procedures established
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common credential issues
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard configured for subscription metrics
- [ ] Knowledge transfer session completed with development team

## Technical Requirements

### App Store Connect API Setup

#### Required Permissions
- **In-App Purchase**: Read access for receipt validation
- **Sales and Trends**: Read access for subscription analytics
- **App Store Connect Users**: Admin role for API key generation

#### API Key Configuration
```javascript
// Firebase Functions environment configuration
firebase functions:config:set \
  appstore.key_id="YOUR_KEY_ID" \
  appstore.issuer_id="YOUR_ISSUER_ID" \
  appstore.bundle_id="com.growth" \
  appstore.shared_secret="YOUR_SHARED_SECRET"
```

#### Private Key Storage
- Store AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 file in secure cloud storage
- Configure Firebase Functions to access private key
- Set appropriate file permissions (read-only for functions)

### Webhook Configuration

#### App Store Server Notifications V2
- **Production URL**: `https://us-central1-growth-70a85.cloudfunctions.net/handleAppStoreNotification`
- **Sandbox URL**: `https://us-central1-growth-70a85.cloudfunctions.net/handleAppStoreNotificationSandbox`
- **Notification Types**: All subscription events enabled

#### Security Configuration
- Webhook signature verification using shared secret
- HTTPS enforcement for all endpoints
- Request origin validation

### Firebase Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production environment
firebase functions:config:set \
  appstore.environment="production" \
  appstore.key_path="./keys/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8" \
  monitoring.slack_webhook="YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK"

# Development environment
firebase functions:config:set \
  appstore.environment="sandbox" \
  appstore.use_sandbox="true"
```

#### Firestore Security Rules Update
```javascript
// Subscription data access rules
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow write: if false; // Only server can write subscription data
}

match /subscriptionCache/{userId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow write: if false; // Only server can write cache
}
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Upload private key to secure cloud storage
2. Configure Firebase Functions environment variables
3. Update webhook URLs in App Store Connect
4. Deploy updated Firebase Functions
5. Verify credential access from functions

### Phase 3: End-to-End Validation (Dev Task - 60 minutes)
1. Test receipt validation with sandbox receipts
2. Trigger test webhook notifications
3. Verify Firestore updates
4. Test cross-device synchronization
5. Validate error handling and monitoring

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Dev Task - 30 minutes)
1. Security audit of credential storage
2. Configure monitoring alerts
3. Document troubleshooting procedures
4. Create credential rotation plan
5. Schedule knowledge transfer session

5. Finance team revenue recognition setup

## Business Continuity Planning

### Revenue Protection Strategy
- **During Credential Rotation**: Maintain cached validations for 24-hour grace period
- **Service Disruption**: Automatic fallback to local validation preserves user access
- **SLA Commitment**: 99.9% uptime for validation endpoints (43 minutes downtime/month max)
- **Customer Communication**: Pre-drafted notifications for any service interruptions

### Operational Continuity
- **Primary Contact**: [Product Owner Name] - Credential generation authority
- **Backup Contact**: [Engineering Lead Name] - Technical implementation
- **Escalation Path**: PO → Engineering Lead → CTO
- **24/7 On-Call**: Engineering team rotation for critical issues

### Financial Continuity
- **Revenue Recognition**: Coordinated with finance team for proper accounting
- **Refund Handling**: Automated webhook processing for chargebacks
- **Billing Disputes**: Support team escalation procedures documented

## Security Considerations

### Credential Protection
- Private key never stored in source control
- Access limited to Firebase Functions service account
- Audit logging for all credential usage
- Automated alerts for suspicious activity

### Key Rotation Strategy
- Quarterly key rotation schedule
- Zero-downtime rotation procedure
- Automated rotation reminders
- Rollback plan for failed rotations

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege for API permissions
- Service account isolation
- Multi-factor authentication for App Store Connect
- Regular access reviews

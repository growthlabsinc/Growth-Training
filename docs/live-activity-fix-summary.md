# Live Activity Progress Bar Fix Summary

## Problem
The Live Activity progress bar was not updating in real-time. It would remain static until about 5 seconds, then suddenly jump to the current position and freeze again.

## Root Cause
The implementation was using manual progress calculations with static `ProgressView(value:)` which doesn't work properly in Live Activities. Apple's documentation specifically states that Live Activities require using `ProgressView(timerInterval:)` for automatic updates.

## Solution
Replaced manual progress calculations with Apple's native timer interval API:

### Before (Not Working):
```swift
// Manual calculation that doesn't update
let progressValue = totalDuration > 0 ? min(max(elapsedTime / totalDuration, 0), 1) : 0
ProgressView(value: progressValue, total: 1.0)
```

### After (Working):
```swift
// Native timer interval that updates automatically
ProgressView(timerInterval: context.state.startTime...context.state.endTime, countsDown: false)
    .progressViewStyle(.linear)
    .tint(Color(red: 0.2, green: 0.8, blue: 0.4))
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivity.swift**
   - Dynamic Island progress bar (lines 189-193)
   - Lock Screen progress bar (lines 544-549)
   - Used `ProgressView(timerInterval:)` for running state
   - Kept static progress for paused state

2. **manageLiveActivityUpdates.js**
   - Fixed nested data structure reading (`timerData.contentState`)
   - Changed update interval from 1s to 0.1s for smoother updates
   - Uses development APNs endpoint

3. **LiveActivityManager.swift**
   - Added notification permission checks
   - Enhanced push token registration logging
   - Better debugging output

## Why This Works
- `ProgressView(timerInterval:)` uses the system's built-in timer rendering
- Updates automatically without requiring push notifications for visual progress
- Push notifications are still used for state changes (pause/resume/stop)
- The progress bar now updates smoothly at 60fps instead of jumping

## Testing Requirements
- Must use real device (simulator doesn't support push tokens)
- iOS 16.2+ for push token support
- Proper APNs configuration in Firebase
- Notification permissions enabled

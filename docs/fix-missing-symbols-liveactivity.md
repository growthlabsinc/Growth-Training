# Fix for Missing Symbols in LiveActivityManager

## Problem
LiveActivityManager.swift reports several "Cannot find in scope" errors:
- `AppGroupConstants`
- `LiveActivityPushService`
- `AppCheckDebugHelper`

## Root Cause
All these files exist in the project but aren't being recognized by the compiler. This typically happens due to:
1. Xcode indexing issues
2. Module cache corruption
3. Target membership problems
4. Build artifacts from previous builds

## Solution

### Step 1: Clean Build Artifacts
Run the provided clean script:
```bash
./clean_and_build.sh
```

### Step 2: Verify Target Membership in Xcode
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. For each of these files, verify they're included in the main "Growth" target:
   - `Growth/Core/Utilities/AppGroupConstants.swift`
   - `Growth/Features/Timer/Services/LiveActivityPushService.swift`
   - `Growth/Core/Networking/AppCheckDebugHelper.swift`

3. Select each file in Xcode's navigator
4. In the File Inspector (right panel), ensure "Growth" is checked under "Target Membership"

### Step 3: Re-index the Project
1. Close Xcode completely
2. Delete DerivedData: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Growth-*`
3. Reopen Xcode and let it re-index

### Step 4: Build
1. Select Product â†’ Build (Cmd+B)
2. The errors should be resolved

## Alternative Solutions

### If errors persist after cleaning:

1. **Check for Circular Dependencies**
   - Ensure LiveActivityManager isn't imported by any of the files it's trying to use
   - Check import statements in all related files

2. **Verify File Locations**
   - All files are in their expected locations:
     - AppGroupConstants: `Growth/Core/Utilities/`
     - LiveActivityPushService: `Growth/Features/Timer/Services/`
     - AppCheckDebugHelper: `Growth/Core/Networking/`

3. **Force Re-add Files**
   - Remove references to problematic files in Xcode (keep files on disk)
   - Re-add them to the project ensuring correct target membership

## Quick Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check if files exist
ls -la Growth/Core/Utilities/AppGroupConstants.swift
ls -la Growth/Features/Timer/Services/LiveActivityPushService.swift
ls -la Growth/Core/Networking/AppCheckDebugHelper.swift

# Search for duplicate definitions
find . -name "AppGroupConstants.swift" -type f
find . -name "LiveActivityPushService.swift" -type f
find . -name "AppCheckDebugHelper.swift" -type f
```

## Prevention
- Always clean build folder when moving files
- Check target membership when adding new files
- Use Xcode's refactoring tools for moving files

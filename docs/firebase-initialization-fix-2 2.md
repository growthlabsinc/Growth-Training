# Firebase Initialization Fix - Round 2

## Summary
Fixed the Firebase initialization race condition that was causing `I-COR000003` errors and subsequent App Check failures.

## Root Cause
The error "The default Firebase app has not yet been configured" was occurring because various services were trying to access Firebase before `FirebaseApp.configure()` was called.

## Changes Made

### 1. AppDelegate.swift
- Added unconditional Firebase configuration at the very beginning of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`
- Removed the guard check that was expecting Firebase to be initialized elsewhere
- Now calls `FirebaseApp.configure()` if not already configured

### 2. GrowthAppApp.swift  
- Moved Firebase configuration to be the FIRST operation in init()
- Moved Firebase logging configuration AFTER Firebase is configured
- This ensures Firebase is ready before any other initialization

### 3. AuthViewModel.swift
- Added Firebase configuration check before subscribing to auth state
- Defers auth subscription setup if Firebase is not yet configured
- Prevents premature access to Firebase Auth services

### 4. AuthService.swift (Previous Fix)
- Already fixed to use lazy computed properties for Firebase services
- Added configuration check in init with deferred setup

## Next Steps

1. **Clean Build**
   ```bash
   # Clean DerivedData
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Growth-*
   
   # Clean build folder in Xcode
   # Cmd+Shift+K in Xcode
   ```

2. **Register App Check Token**
   - Token: `DC769389-3431-4556-A9BB-44B79AF64E65`
   - Go to Firebase Console → App Check → Manage Debug Tokens
   - Add the token with a descriptive name

3. **Run and Test**
   - Build and run the app
   - Check Xcode console for:
     - "✅ Firebase configured in AppDelegate" 
     - No more `I-COR000003` errors
     - No more App Check 403 errors (after token registration)

## Technical Details

The fix ensures Firebase is initialized in the correct order:
1. GrowthAppApp.init() → FirebaseClient.configure() → FirebaseApp.configure()
2. AppDelegate.didFinishLaunchingWithOptions() → Checks and configures if needed
3. All services now check for Firebase configuration before accessing

This eliminates the race condition where services were trying to access Firebase before it was configured.

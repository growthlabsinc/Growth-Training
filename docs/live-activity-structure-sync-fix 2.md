# Live Activity Structure Synchronization Fix

## Issue
Live Activity was being dismissed immediately after creation due to:
1. Mismatched TimerActivityAttributes structures between main app and widget
2. Widget receiving timestamps like 1752627855 but decoding them as 774320655 (year 1994)
3. Decoding failures causing immediate dismissal

## Root Cause
The widget had a simplified TimerActivityAttributes structure while the main app had a complex one with:
- Custom date decoding logic
- Additional fields for time tracking
- Date validation to prevent 1994 timestamps

## Solution
Synchronized the TimerActivityAttributes structure by:
1. Copying the main app's complete structure to the widget
2. Updating widget code to use the new structure's computed properties
3. Maintaining Apple's best practices (no direct Live Activity updates from widget)

## Key Changes

### 1. TimerActivityAttributes.swift (Widget)
- Now identical to main app version
- Includes custom decoding for Unix timestamps
- Has date validation (rejects timestamps before 2020)
- Includes all tracking fields

### 2. GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivity.swift
- Updated to use `currentElapsedTime` and `currentRemainingTime` computed properties
- Added completion state handling
- Uses `context.attributes.totalDuration` instead of `state.totalDuration`

### 3. TimerControlIntent.swift
- Updated to use computed properties
- Stores complete state including completion status

### 4. LiveActivityUpdateManager.swift
- Uses computed `currentElapsedTime` property

## Benefits
1. **No more decoding errors** - Both sides use same structure
2. **Proper date handling** - Validates timestamps to prevent 1994 dates
3. **Live Activity stability** - Should no longer dismiss immediately
4. **Pause functionality** - Proper state tracking with all fields

## Testing
The Live Activity should now:
- Start and display correctly
- Show proper time (0:01:00 not 1:00:00)
- Not dismiss immediately
- Handle pause/resume via Darwin notifications

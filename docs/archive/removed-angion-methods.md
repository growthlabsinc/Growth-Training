# Archived Angion Method Definitions

**Archive Date**: 2025-01-19
**Reason for Removal**: Content migration from Angion Method methodology to PE-focused training protocols

## Removed Method Definitions

### Angion Method 1.0
- **ID**: `angion_method_1_0` (alias: `am1_0`)
- **Stage**: 2
- **Classification**: Foundation
- **Description**: Venous-focused technique to improve blood flow. Foundational vascular training.
- **Instructions**: Obtain an erection and apply water or silicone-based lubricant along the dorsal side. Place thumbs on dorsal veins, stroke downward from glans to base alternating thumbs. Start slowly, aim to increase pace. Maintain for 20-30 minutes.

### Angion Method 2.0
- **ID**: `am2_0`
- **Stage**: 3
- **Classification**: Intermediate
- **Description**: Advanced vascular training focusing on arterial side manipulation.
- **Instructions**: Obtain an erection, lightly grip the shaft and glans, alternate squeezes to force arterial flow. Maintain low pelvic floor engagement.

### Angion Method 2.5 (Jelq 2.0)
- **ID**: `angion_method_2_5`
- **Stage**: 4
- **Classification**: Intermediate
- **Description**: Bridge technique between AM 2.0 and 3.0, focusing on Corpora Spongiosum development.
- **Instructions**: Obtain erection, apply lubricant. Using first two fingers, depress corpora spongiosum with thumb facing down. Pull upward with partial grip focusing force on CS. Start slow, increase speed as session progresses.

### Angion Method 3.0 (Vascion)
- **ID**: `angion_method_3_0` (alias: `vascion`)
- **Stage**: 5
- **Classification**: Expert
- **Description**: The pinnacle hand technique focusing on Corpora Spongiosum stimulation for maximum vascular development.
- **Instructions**: Lay on back, apply liberal lubricant to CS. Using middle fingers, depress CS while stroking upward in alternating fashion. Maintain rapid alternating strokes for full session.

### SABRE Type A
- **ID**: `sabre_type_a`
- **Stage**: 2
- **Classification**: Foundation
- **Description**: Foundation SABRE strikes for EQ improvement and vascular development.
- **Instructions**: Using hand strikes at 1-3 per second with light force. Focus 10 minutes each on left corporal body, right corporal body, and glans. Work with flaccid to partially erect state.

### SABRE Type B
- **ID**: `sabre_type_b`
- **Stage**: 3
- **Classification**: Intermediate
- **Description**: Intermediate SABRE strikes with increased pace and force.
- **Instructions**: Using hand strikes at 3-5 per second with moderate force. Focus 10 minutes each on left corporal body, right corporal body, and glans. Work with partially erect state.

### SABRE Type C
- **ID**: `sabre_type_c`
- **Stage**: 4
- **Classification**: Intermediate
- **Description**: Advanced SABRE strikes focusing on speed with controlled force.
- **Instructions**: Using hand strikes at 5-7 per second with moderate force. Focus 10 minutes each on left corporal body, right corporal body, and glans. Maintain control and precision.

### SABRE Type D
- **ID**: `sabre_type_d`
- **Stage**: 5
- **Classification**: Expert
- **Description**: Peak SABRE technique with maximum speed and intensity. Expert level only.
- **Instructions**: Using hand strikes at 7+ per second with high force. Focus 10 minutes each on left corporal body, right corporal body, and glans. Requires mastery of Types A-C.

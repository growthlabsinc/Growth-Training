# Fix for GrowthTimerWidget Module Import Issue

## Problem
The error "No such module 'GrowthTimerWidget'" occurs because:
1. The widget extension is named `GrowthTimerWidgetExtension` in the project
2. `TimerActivityAttributes` is duplicated in both the main app and widget extension
3. The import statement is unnecessary since the struct exists in the main app

## Solution Applied
1. Removed the unnecessary import of `GrowthTimerWidget` from `LiveActivityManager.swift`
2. The `TimerActivityAttributes` struct in the main app (at `Growth/Features/Timer/Models/TimerActivityAttributes.swift`) is already accessible without any import

## Root Cause
The widget extension and main app both need access to `TimerActivityAttributes`. Instead of importing the widget module, both targets should share the same source file through target membership.

## Recommended Long-term Fix
To properly share code between the main app and widget extension:

1. In Xcode, select `TimerActivityAttributes.swift` in the main app
2. In the File Inspector, under "Target Membership", check both:
   - ✓ Growth (main app)
   - ✓ GrowthTimerWidgetExtension

3. Remove the duplicate `TimerActivityAttributes.swift` from the widget extension folder

## Alternative Solution
If you need to keep separate files, create a shared framework target that both the main app and widget can import.

## Build Instructions
1. Clean Build Folder (Shift+Cmd+K)
2. Build the project (Cmd+B)
3. The error should be resolved

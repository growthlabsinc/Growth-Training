# Production APNS Key Deployed ✅

## Summary
Successfully deployed both development and production APNS keys for Live Activity push notifications.

## Keys Configured

### Development/Sandbox
- **Key ID**: 55LZB28UY2
- **Environment**: Sandbox
- **Secret Name**: APNS_AUTH_KEY_55LZB28UY2
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed

### Production
- **Key ID**: DQ46FN4PQU  
- **Environment**: Production
- **Secret Name**: APNS_AUTH_KEY_DQ46FN4PQU
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed

## Implementation Details

### Dual-Key Strategy
The Firebase Functions now automatically select the correct key based on the environment:
- Development builds → Uses 55LZB28UY2 (Sandbox)
- Production builds → Uses DQ46FN4PQU (Production)

### Logging Improvements
- Replaced `console.log` with Firebase Functions `logger`
- Better structured logging in Google Cloud Console
- Easier debugging and monitoring

## Functions Updated
All three Live Activity functions now have both keys available:
- ✅ `updateLiveActivity`
- ✅ `registerLiveActivityPushToken`
- ✅ `registerPushToStartToken`

## Testing

### Development
The app should continue working as before with the sandbox key.

### Production (TestFlight/App Store)
The production key will be automatically used when:
- App is built with Release configuration
- Deployed via TestFlight or App Store

## Verification
To verify the keys are working:
```bash
firebase functions:log -n 20
```

Look for:
- "Dev Key available: true"
- "Prod Key available: true"

## Next Steps
1. Test in development to ensure sandbox key still works
2. Build for TestFlight to test production key
3. Monitor Firebase Functions logs for any issues

Both environments are now fully configured for Live Activity push notifications!

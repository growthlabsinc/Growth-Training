# Live Activity Test Results

## Test Environment
- Device: Physical iOS device (required for Live Activities)
- iOS Version: Based on logs showing iOS 16.1+ APIs
- Test Duration: ~18 seconds
- Timer Configuration: 1 minute countdown timer

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Successful Operations

1. **Live Activity Creation**
   - Activity ID: `00F73120-A7F5-4FD0-96C8-AC33CBD12523`
   - Initial state: `active` (not stale)
   - Stale date: Set to 8 hours in future as intended
   - Push token received successfully

2. **Pause Operation**
   - Darwin notification received correctly
   - Timestamps remained unchanged (critical fix working)
   - isPaused flag updated to `true`
   - Elapsed time stored: 4.399 seconds
   - Activity remained in `active` state (not stale)

3. **Resume Operation**
   - Darwin notification received correctly
   - Timestamps remained unchanged (critical fix working)
   - isPaused flag updated to `false`
   - Activity resumed from stored elapsed time
   - Activity remained in `active` state (not stale)

4. **Background/Foreground Transition**
   - App went to background at ~10 seconds
   - Returned to foreground at ~17 seconds
   - Live Activity correctly calculated elapsed time during background
   - Timer resumed automatically with correct time

### ⚠️ Important Observations

1. **No Stale State Issues**
   - The activity never became stale during the test
   - This suggests the freezing issue may be:
     - Device-specific
     - Related to longer pause durations
     - UI rendering issue rather than data issue

2. **Push Notifications**
   - Push updates were sent successfully
   - Server responded with success for all operations
   - No errors in push notification delivery

3. **Widget Extension**
   - Widget received pause/resume intents
   - Local updates were applied immediately
   - No error logs from widget extension

## Potential Remaining Issues

1. **UI Update Lag**
   - Even though data is correct, the UI might not be updating
   - Need to monitor widget-specific logs to see rendering

2. **Long Duration Testing**
   - Test only ran for 18 seconds
   - Freezing might occur after longer pause periods
   - Need extended testing (5+ minutes paused)

3. **Screen Lock Testing**
   - Test didn't include screen lock during pause
   - This is a critical scenario to test

## Next Steps

1. **Run Extended Test**
   ```bash
   # Start timer, pause for 5+ minutes with screen locked
   ./monitor_widget_logs.sh
   ```

2. **Check Widget Rendering**
   - Look for "WIDGET UI:" debug messages
   - Verify UI updates match data updates

3. **Test Specific Scenarios**
   - Pause → Lock screen → Wait 5 min → Unlock → Resume
   - Pause → Background app → Wait → Resume
   - Multiple pause/resume cycles

## Debug Commands

Monitor widget logs specifically:
```bash
./monitor_widget_logs.sh
```

Monitor all Live Activity logs:
```bash
./debug_live_activity.sh
```

Check current Live Activity state:
```swift
LiveActivityManager.shared.debugPrintCurrentState()
```

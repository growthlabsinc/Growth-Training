# 5x Timer Speed Developer Option Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a safe 5x timer speed multiplier for development/testing purposes that avoids the issues from previous implementations.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. TimerService Changes
- Added `static var debugSpeedMultiplier: Double = 1.0` property (only in DEBUG builds)
- Added `actualElapsedTime` property to track real time separately from displayed time
- Modified `tick()` method to apply multiplier: `elapsedTime = actualElapsedTime * debugSpeedMultiplier`
- Added computed property `isDebugSpeedActive` to check if speed mode is active

### 2. State Persistence
- Save actual elapsed time (not multiplied) to UserDefaults for accurate restoration
- When restoring, apply multiplier to the restored time
- Background time calculations also apply the multiplier correctly

### 3. DevelopmentToolsView Integration
- Toggle now properly sets `TimerService.debugSpeedMultiplier`
- Toggle state initializes based on saved multiplier value
- Speed multiplier persists across app launches via UserDefaults

### 4. Visual Indicators
- Added prominent "DEV MODE: 5x Speed" badge in TimerView
- Badge has pulsing animation when timer is running
- Orange color scheme makes it obvious when debug mode is active
- Only shown in DEBUG builds

### 5. Session Logging Accuracy
- Session logs record actual duration, not the multiplied time
- SessionProgress uses `Date().timeIntervalSince(startTime)` for accurate time tracking
- Method durations in multi-method sessions also use actual time

## How It Works

1. **Time Calculation**: 
   - Timer ticks every 0.1 seconds
   - Calculates actual elapsed time from start date
   - Multiplies by debug speed (5x if enabled, 1x if disabled)
   - Updates UI with multiplied time

2. **Background Handling**:
   - Saves actual elapsed time when going to background
   - When restoring, applies multiplier to time passed in background
   - Ensures consistent behavior across app states

3. **Completion Detection**:
   - Timer completion logic uses the multiplied elapsed time
   - Countdown timers complete 5x faster when enabled
   - Interval timers progress through intervals 5x faster

## Testing Considerations

1. **Enable/Disable**: Toggle in Settings > Development Tools > 5x Timer Speed
2. **Visual Confirmation**: Orange "DEV MODE: 5x Speed" badge appears on timer
3. **Background Test**: Start timer, background app, return - timer should maintain speed
4. **Session Logs**: Check that logged durations reflect actual time, not 5x time
5. **Different Modes**: Test with stopwatch, countdown, and interval timers

## Safety Measures

1. Only available in DEBUG builds
2. Clear visual indicators when active
3. Actual time tracked separately for accurate logging
4. State persistence handles multiplier correctly
5. No impact on production builds

This implementation avoids previous issues by:
- Keeping actual and simulated time separate
- Applying multiplier consistently everywhere
- Providing clear visual feedback
- Properly handling all state transitions
- Ensuring accurate session logging

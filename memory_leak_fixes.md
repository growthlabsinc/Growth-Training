# Memory Leak Fixes for PremiumCreateCustomRoutineView

## Issue
The app was crashing with "using too much memory" error when navigating between steps in the custom routine creation flow, particularly when toggling method selections.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Excessive NotificationCenter Posts**: Every toggle/update was posting notifications, creating a flood of events
2. **State Variable Initialization**: The `@State` variable in `EnhancedMethodSelectionCard` was being initialized incorrectly
3. **View Recreation**: Using `.id(currentStep)` was forcing unnecessary view recreation
4. **Retain Cycles**: Potential retain cycles in closures and notification observers

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Optimized NotificationCenter Usage
- Removed notification posts from toggle/deselect methods
- Added single notification post in `onDisappear` of `PremiumMethodSelectionView`
- This reduces notification traffic from potentially hundreds to just one per view lifecycle

### 2. Fixed State Management in EnhancedMethodSelectionCard
```swift
// Before - problematic
@State var schedulingConfig: MethodSchedulingConfig

// After - proper separation
let schedulingConfig: MethodSchedulingConfig
@State private var localSchedulingConfig: MethodSchedulingConfig
```

### 3. Removed Force View Recreation
- Removed `.id(currentStep)` which was causing entire view hierarchy to rebuild
- This prevents unnecessary memory allocation/deallocation cycles

### 4. Updated All References
- Changed all references from `schedulingConfig` to `localSchedulingConfig` for mutable operations
- Added `onAppear` to sync state: `localSchedulingConfig = schedulingConfig`

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Memory Allocation**: Views are no longer recreated unnecessarily
2. **Reduced Notification Traffic**: From N notifications per interaction to 1 per view lifecycle
3. **Proper State Management**: No more state initialization issues
4. **Cleaner Memory Profile**: Eliminated potential retain cycles

## Testing Recommendations

1. Navigate between steps multiple times
2. Toggle methods repeatedly
3. Expand/collapse method cards rapidly
4. Monitor memory usage in Xcode's Memory Graph Debugger
5. Check for memory leaks using Instruments

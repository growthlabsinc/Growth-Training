# Live Activity Widget Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. Live Activity widget on lock screen had poor layout with missing text labels and control buttons
2. Widget showed incorrect height, margins, and padding
3. Widget displayed "PAUSED" state even when timer should have ended
4. Widget didn't dismiss when timer completed or user stopped it

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Lock Screen Widget Layout (`GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivity.swift`)
- Redesigned the lock screen view with more compact, properly sized layout
- Fixed timer display to be more prominent (48pt font size)
- Simplified session info to single line with method name and pause indicator
- Made control buttons more compact with proper spacing
- Constrained widget height to 150px for better lock screen fit
- Removed unnecessary decorative elements that weren't visible

### 2. Fixed Live Activity Dismissal on Timer Completion (`TimerService.swift`)
- Already had proper Live Activity dismissal in `handleTimerCompletion()` method
- Timer completion now properly ends the Live Activity

### 3. Improved Live Activity Dismissal Policy (`LiveActivityManager.swift`)
- Changed from `.default` to `.immediate` dismissal policy
- Widget now disappears immediately when timer ends or user stops it
- No more lingering "PAUSED" state widgets

## Key Changes

### GrowthTimerWidgetLiveActivity.swift
```swift
// Before: Complex layout with decorative elements
// After: Simplified, compact layout optimized for lock screen
struct TimerLockScreenView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 0) {
            VStack(spacing: 8) {
                // Large, prominent timer display
                Text(timerInterval: ...)
                    .font(.system(size: 48, weight: .bold, design: .monospaced))
                
                // Single-line session info
                HStack { 
                    Image(systemName: "timer")
                    Text(context.state.methodName)
                    if context.state.isPaused { Text("â€¢ PAUSED") }
                }
                
                // Compact control buttons
                HStack(spacing: 8) {
                    Link("Pause/Resume") { ... }
                    Link("Stop") { ... }
                }
            }
            .padding(.horizontal, 16)
            .padding(.vertical, 12)
        }
        .frame(maxHeight: 150) // Constrained height
    }
}
```

### LiveActivityManager.swift
```swift
// Changed dismissal policy from .default to .immediate
await activity.end(ActivityContent(state: finalState, staleDate: nil), dismissalPolicy: .immediate)
```

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Start a timer (regular or quick practice)
2. Check the lock screen widget displays correctly with proper layout
3. Verify pause/resume buttons work from the widget
4. Let the timer complete naturally - widget should dismiss immediately
5. Or stop the timer manually - widget should dismiss immediately
6. No more "PAUSED" state widgets should remain after timer ends
